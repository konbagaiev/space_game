# Vega Sentinels — decisions and notes

The prototype: a single `index.html` file, Three.js from a CDN (via importmap). Opens with a
double click in the browser, nothing to install.

---

## 1. Engine: Three.js (not Godot/Unity)

**Why:** for "a few 3D ships fighting on a plane" we need the fastest possible start.
Three.js = one HTML file, no installation, instant result, easy to share.
Unity is heavy (Hub, license, C#), Godot needs an editor and installation.

**When to reconsider Godot:** when we get to physics (real collisions),
a visual level editor, or multiplayer — that's where an engine truly pays off.
For now Three.js isn't holding us back.

---

## 2. Ship controls and physics (inertia)

An "Asteroids-like" model:
- `W/S` (or `↑/↓`) — thrust forward/backward along the nose.
- `A/D` (or `←/→`) — turn only the nose, without touching the movement vector.
- `Space` — fire.

Specifics:
- **Pure inertia:** no friction, no speed limit while thrusting — we fly along the accumulated
  vector, wherever the nose is pointing (you can drift sideways and shoot forward).
- **Passive braking:** if NOT a SINGLE control button is pressed — velocity smoothly
  decays (`IDLE_DRAG`). Hold a turn to aim and the inertia is preserved.
- **Arena boundaries (soft, since 2026-06-22):** the player may fly past ±360 freely — there is **no
  hard wall**. Earlier we zeroed the axis velocity at the wall, which read as a bug (the ship "stuck"
  to an invisible edge). Now a faint glowing edge marker shows where the battlefield ends; after the
  ship is **2 s continuously out of bounds** a HUD warning + countdown appears, and after **30 s** out
  the ship is **warped back to center** (velocity zeroed, reusing the enemy warp-in animation). A
  corner mini-map/radar gives spatial awareness. **Nothing is hard-clamped to the arena** — enemies
  chase the player out and spawn around it (no edge clamp), and bullets/rockets fly normally beyond
  ±360 (limited only by range/hits), so combat works fully out of bounds; ±360 only drives the
  boundary UI. (The old `clampToArena` clamp was removed.) See `docs/plans/arena-boundaries.md`.

Knobs: `ACCEL` (acceleration), `TURN` (turning), `IDLE_DRAG` (braking), `ARENA` (size),
`OOB_WARN_DELAY` (warning grace, 2 s), `OOB_RETURN_TIME` (auto-return, 30 s).

**Amendment (§39, 2026-07-03):** two clauses above are now qualified by the return-to-base flow. Enemies
spawn around **`arenaCenter`** (the mission zone center), **not** "around the player" — early in a fight
the player is at center so it reads the same, but after they wander the waves still originate at the zone.
And the **30 s OOB auto-warp is suspended while returning to base** (after the last kill), so a side mission
fought far from `(0,0)` can fly the whole way home without being yanked back. See §39.

**Amendment (§51, 2026-07-05):** the "no speed limit" clause above is now narrowed for the PLAYER
only — player velocity is capped at a flat `PLAYER_MAX_SPEED = 30` u/s (a movement-system constant,
not a per-engine stat). §2's inertia otherwise still holds: no friction while thrusting, passive
`IDLE_DRAG` braking on release, and free drift. **Enemies are unchanged** — they still clamp to their
per-engine `maxSpeed`. See §51.

---

## 3. Camera

- Nearly vertical (top-down view), **fixed angle**, does NOT rotate with the ship's turn.
- **Rigidly attached to the player** (`CAM_OFFSET`), without smoothing/lag — otherwise switching
  direction caused "jitter" and a slight "floating".

---

## 4. Background: three layers by depth

1. **Stars** — a distant static backdrop, glued to the camera (no parallax). Varying
   brightness (a power-law distribution: many dim ones, rare bright ones). **A bright ~2% are a
   separate point layer** (`makeStars`, `brightFraction`): for a ~1px point, raw color value caps at
   white and barely reads as "brighter," so the bright subset uses the three cues that actually work —
   **bigger size** (5 vs 1.4 px), a **soft additive glow sprite** (radial-gradient `CanvasTexture` → a
   round bloom, not a hard square), and a **near-white, full-luminance color**. Considered but rejected
   for now: a bloom post-process (`UnrealBloomPass`) — real HDR glow, but a whole extra pass that would
   entangle the two-pass sky/combat split and risk combat readability (§5), overkill for a backdrop.
   The bright layer is `depthTest: true` (the dim layer is `depthTest: false`) so the planet/moons
   occlude it; this is the transparency-friendly alternative to the "make stars opaque" fix in §5 — it
   keeps the additive glow from creeping onto the planet disk.
2. **Asteroids** — a small layer BEHIND the combat plane, in world coordinates (NOT attached
   to the camera). When flying they rush past → giving a sense of speed. A single `InstancedMesh`
   (1 draw call). Knobs: `ROCK_COUNT`, size, `ROCK_SPREAD`.
3. **Planet + 2 moons** — light parallax (`PARALLAX`), so depth is felt.
   The moons orbit the planet (`updateMoons`), they don't rotate themselves → terminators stay consistent.

---

## 5. Lighting — TWO independent lights via two render passes (important!)

**The task:** light the combat with one light, the planet/moons with another (with a real day/night).

**What did NOT work (dead ends):**
- **Light layers (`layers`)** — didn't give a clean separation. At the very least `AmbientLight`
  is global and ignores layers → it flooded the planet flatly, killing the terminator.
- **Baking day/night into vertex colors** (`MeshBasic`) — it worked, but the planet came out
  flat/unrealistic (no volume and no soft terminator from real light).

**What worked (the current solution):** two render passes, each with its own scene and its own light.
- `scene` (combat: ships, rocks, bullets, explosions) — its own light: `AmbientLight` + `sun`.
- `skyScene` (planet, moons, stars) — its own light: a weak ambient (the night side) +
  a side `skySun` (gives a real terminator).
- The loop: `renderer.autoClear=false`; `clear()` → `render(skyScene)` → `clearDepth()` →
  `render(scene)`. The space background is drawn by `skyScene.background`, with `scene.background = null`.

Knobs: planet day — the intensity of `skySun` and its position (= the "sun" direction);
night — the ambient in `skyScene`; combat — the light in `scene` (no need to touch it, it's "correct").

**Stars vs transparency:** the stars are made NON-transparent (`transparent:false`) + `depthWrite:false`
+ `renderOrder:-1`. Otherwise (as transparent) they were drawn AFTER the planet and crept onto its disk.

---

## 6. Combat

- Enemies: **2 hits** (hp 2, shot damage 1). 4 enemies, spawning in a ring around the player.
- Enemy AI: turn toward the player → keep your distance (~14–22) → shoot once aimed.
- A **micro-explosion** at the hit point: a short (`EXPLOSION_LIFE ≈ 0.16s`) fiery flash
  (an additive sphere, quickly expanding and fading).
- A **ship-destruction burst** (`spawnShipExplosion`) when a ship dies — deliberately louder than the
  hit-flash: stacked fireball layers (white core → orange → red, each bigger/slower via the now
  tunable `life`/`color` of `spawnExplosion`), a radial spray of ~22 colored sparks (own pool, with
  drag), and a flat additive shockwave ring expanding on the plane. Tinted by the ship's color.

### Engine trail (exhaust)

The `trail` system (analogous to explosions): when thrusting forward (`W`/`↑`), glowing additive
particles fly out of the nozzle, fading and shrinking over `TRAIL_LIFE` (~0.55s).

The particle physics matters: **the starting velocity = the ship's velocity + ejection backward along the nozzle**
(`shipVel + (-fwd) * EXHAUST_SPEED`). So the exhaust depends on the ship's motion (at speed
it flies along with it rather than lagging behind) and on the nozzle direction (`-fwd`); when turning while drifting
the jet goes along the new nose direction.

The exhaust parameters now live in the **engine** (`engine.exhaust`): `speed` (how fast
the particles separate backward), `life` (trail length), `size` (thickness), `spread` (scatter), `color`.
See section 8 about the component-based model.

---

## 7. How to check the picture (for development)

A regular screen capture is blocked by the system. Instead — a headless render via Playwright
(headless Chromium, software WebGL). This is now a committed, stable suite: **`client/visual/`**
(`npm run test:visual` from `client/`), see `client/visual/README.md`. It boots the real game and
asserts on **simulation state** (particle counts, size ratios, exhaust colors) through a
`?debug`-gated `window.__game` hook, and saves PNG frames to `__screenshots__/` for the eye.

Design choices: **no pixel diffing** (software WebGL differs between machines → flaky baselines;
screenshots are review artifacts, not pass/fail), and the suite is **kept out of CI** (slower, needs
a browser binary) — run it by hand before a larger/rarer release. CI keeps running only the fast unit
tests. For one-off experiments, an ad-hoc script under `/tmp` loading `http://localhost:4000/` works too.
⚠️ Caveat: swiftshader in headless sometimes diverges from a real browser in subtle things
(transparency order) — do the final check in a real browser.

---

## 8. Ship model: data components

**Why:** to move away from a scatter of hardcoded constants toward a structure from which a ship
is assembled — groundwork for upgrades, different ships/enemies, and balance.

Catalogs in `client/index.html`: `ENGINES`, `HULLS`, `WEAPONS`. A ship (player/enemy) references
components (loadout: `hull` / `engine` / `weapon`), and the logic reads stats from there.

- **The engine** includes the **exhaust** (`exhaust`) as its own part — the trail parameters are taken from
  the engine, not from global constants.
- **Projectiles** carry the damage and speed of their weapon — that's why different weapons produce different bullets from
  a single `spawnBullet(from, dir, weapon, fromPlayer)` function.
- Some fields are intentionally **groundwork** and don't affect logic yet: `weight`, `durability`
  (on the engine), `volume`. They're easy to start using (mass → inertia, durability → failures).

The principle: **a new mechanic = first a stat on a component, then reading it in the logic**,
not a new global constant.

---

## 9. Deployment, rollback, and migrations

Live at **https://vega.tenony.com** — the long-standing canonical prod host; the cutover is done (the
old **https://space.bagaiev.com** is a retired legacy host that may still route — see §12). Docker on a
shared Hetzner VPS, behind Traefik, on the shared Postgres.
Details in `server/README.md`. Key decisions:

**Zero-downtime deploys (blue-green).** The container has a Docker `healthcheck` — Traefik only
routes to it once `/api/health` passes (i.e. after migrations run on startup). Deploy uses
`docker rollout -w 10 app`: new container up → healthy → Traefik picks it up → old removed.
A failed migration ⇒ container never becomes healthy ⇒ rollout keeps the old one. Verified by
polling during a rollout (0 dropped requests). Deploys that change `docker-compose.yml` itself may
blip once (the old container gets recreated for the config change).

**Rollback = swap the image, not the DB.** Each deploy tags the image `spacegame:<git-sha>`; the
CI keeps the 3 newest (current + 2 to roll back to). `rollback.sh` re-tags a previous version to
`:latest` and runs `docker rollout` — zero-downtime, no rebuild.

**Migrations are forward-only.** We do NOT run down-migrations in production (rolling back a
destructive change = data loss). Instead, schema changes follow **expand/contract**: add new
columns/tables (backward-compatible) → ship code that uses them → remove the old ones only in a
LATER release, once the old code can no longer come back. This keeps a code rollback always safe
(the schema works for both versions). Catastrophes are handled by restoring a DB backup, not by
reversing a migration. Current migrations are additive/idempotent, so already backward-compatible.

**Player progress is a FK to `levels(id)`, enforced only in Postgres.** `players.current_progress`
points at the player's highest unlocked level. Postgres declares it as a real `REFERENCES levels(id)`
FK (prod gets referential integrity). SQLite **can't** `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with both a
`REFERENCES` clause and a non-NULL default (it errors regardless of `PRAGMA foreign_keys`), and we'd
rather not do a full table rebuild for the dev/test backend — which doesn't enforce FKs anyway. So the
SQLite column is a plain `INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1`, treated as the same logical FK in queries (the
JOIN works either way). Advancing uses `MIN(id) WHERE id > current` rather than `current + 1`, so it
tolerates non-contiguous level ids (the local DB has gaps from re-seed history). The default `1` assumes
`level-1` is the first seeded level (id 1) — true by seed order in every backend.

---

## 10. Localization (i18n) — English is the source, translations layer on top (planned)

**Decision.** English is the **canonical, source-of-truth language**; multi-language support is a
**localization layer added on top**, not a replacement. **Russian is the first localization language.**

**How this reconciles the "English only" project rule (`CLAUDE.md`).** That rule governs the
*source of truth* — code, identifiers, string **keys**, docs, commits, and the **default/base UI
text** all stay English. It does **not** forbid showing a player translated text: a localized string
is a derived artifact keyed off the English original. So English-only stands for everything we author
and version; locales are generated views of it.

**Planned approach (queued — see sequencing below):**
- **Client UI (~35–40 strings, `client/index.html`):** centralize into a keyed dictionary
  (`client/src/i18n.js`, `t(key, params)`); `en` values are the current English text, so the English
  source is preserved. DOM via `data-i18n` attributes + `t()` for JS-set strings.
- **All translatable text (UI + DB content) flows through ONE file-based message catalog** — the
  source of truth, version-controlled, English-only-rule friendly:
  - `client/locales/source.json` — the canonical catalog: `{ key: { source, context } }`. `source` is
    the English text; `context` is the per-string note for the translator (where it appears, tone,
    length limits) — authored once, travels to the translator (human or AI) automatically. This is the
    gettext `#.` / FormatJS `description` pattern, and it's the whole reason we reject per-column
    translations (a column has nowhere to hold context, and adding a language ALTERs every table).
  - `client/locales/<lang>.json` (e.g. `ru.json`) — `{ key: value }`, the translations. English is NOT
    duplicated here; it comes from `source.json`. **Adding a language = add one file, zero schema change.**
  - **DB content stores stable keys, not display text.** A row carries an i18n key (e.g.
    `ship.player_basic.name`); the canonical English `name`/`text` stays for fallback/debug. Level
    victory `descriptor.phases[].text` becomes `textKey`.
  - **Resolution is client-side:** the client loads `source.json` + the active `<lang>.json` and
    resolves everything through one `t(key, params)` — UI labels and DB content identically. The DB and
    API stay language-agnostic (keys only); the server never resolves content.
  - **Interpolation:** values support simple named placeholders (`Score: {score}`). That's all the
    runtime formatter needs for now.
  - **Plurals/composite phrases — deferred on purpose.** Grammatical number (esp. Russian: 1 враг /
    2 врага / 5 врагов) is the hard part of i18n. **For now we avoid authoring such phrases at all** —
    prefer designs that sidestep grammatical number: a static label next to a separate number
    (`Enemies` + `4`), the `N×` notation (`2× gun`), or a value after a colon (`Destroyed: 12`). At
    planning time **no string requires plurals**, so we don't build plural support yet.
  - **When we do need plurals** (revisit once copy/scale demands it): the chosen mechanism is the
    **built-in `Intl.PluralRules`** (`new Intl.PluralRules('ru').select(5) === 'many'`) — correct CLDR
    categories for free, **zero dependencies** — plus a tiny ICU-subset formatter to pick the branch.
    We will NOT hand-code language plural rules, and NOT add `@formatjs`/any runtime dep (keeps the
    project's built-in-only ethos). Keep new translatable strings simple until then.
- **Language selection:** explicit choice (`players.language`, persisted via a new migration +
  endpoint, mirrored to `localStorage`) → `navigator.language` → `en` fallback. Only `en`/`ru` for now.
  The server stores only the *preference*; resolution stays on the client.

**Sequencing (parallel-work hazard).** i18n heavily overlaps the maps/levels feature in the exact same
files (`index.html`, `catalog_seed.js`, and the migrations sequence — both would add the next `00N`
migration). Do i18n **after** maps/levels merges to `main`, to avoid a large merge-conflict surface.

**As built (deviations from the plan above).** Three small, deliberate divergences:
1. **DB content keys ride in the existing JSON columns, not a new `name_key` column.** The player ship's
   key lives in `ships.stats.nameKey` and the victory line's in `levels.descriptor.phases[].textKey` —
   both upsert with the catalog on startup, so **no content migration** was needed (only `players.language`,
   migration 007, required one). Same architecture (rows carry keys, English stays as fallback), less schema churn.
2. **Only player-visible content is keyed.** Just the player ship gets a `nameKey` (it's the only ship name
   shown — the picker lists player ships only; enemy names never render). Weapon/component names aren't
   displayed, so they aren't keyed yet; adding one later = a key in its JSON + a `source.json`/`ru.json` entry.
3. **The server preference adopts only when non-default.** `players.language` defaults to `'en'`, which is
   indistinguishable from an explicit "I chose English". So the client adopts the server value only when it's
   **non-default** — otherwise a brand-new player's `navigator.language` would be wrongly overridden by the
   `'en'` default. A chosen language still survives a `localStorage` clear (it's a non-default value on the server).

---

## 11. Economy — credits, earned-this-run vs persistent balance

**Decision.** The game currency is **credits**. There are two distinct quantities, intentionally separate:
- **Earned** — credits accrued during the current run (each kill adds the enemy's `reward`; the level-clear
  bonus doubles it). This is the former "score". It's provisional and lives only in the client.
- **Credits** (balance) — the player's persistent account, `players.credits` (default **1000** for new
  players). Server-authoritative.

**Banking happens once, at run end.** On death OR victory the client posts the earned credits to
`/api/games`; the server records the game and atomically adds them to `players.credits`, returning the new
balance (the client trusts that number, never its own arithmetic). A `banked` guard + the server being the
source of truth prevent double-counting. **Closing the browser mid-run loses the unbanked Earned** — by
design: credits are only real once a run completes. Dying still pays out (you keep what you earned), and the
×2 victory bonus is applied to Earned *before* banking.

**Why a persistent balance now** (vs. just renaming score): it's the foundation for spending — buying
hulls/engines/thrusters/weapons from the components catalog. The balance is a plain `INTEGER` column (no FK).

**`games.score` was renamed to `games.credits`** (migration 008; Postgres via an idempotent
`information_schema`-guarded rename) so the history table speaks the same currency. The `/api/games` body
field is `credits`, but the route still accepts a legacy `score` field so an old cached client keeps working.

---

## 11. Player authentication (anonymous-first, optional email/password account) (planned)

**Flow.** Stay anonymous-first. A player keeps the localStorage UUID and auto-registers as today.
**After clearing level 1**, prompt for a **username** (display name) and offer to **register**. Decline →
keep playing anonymously (the username is still saved). Accept → email + password upgrade the *same*
player row in place (progress preserved). Cross-device **progress sync requires a verified email**.

**Decisions:**
- **Password hashing: built-in `crypto.scrypt`** (no dependency — matches the project ethos). Per-user
  random salt; compare with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.
- **Session: server-side token in an httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookie.** The DB stores a hash of the
  token (a DB leak doesn't expose live sessions); the cookie holds the raw token. Same-origin + HTTPS
  (Traefik) already in place. No `cookie-parser` dep — parse the `Cookie` header with a small helper.
- **Username = display name; login is by email.** Not unique, not a credential. (Unique handles can come
  later.)
- **Identity model:** the `players.id` UUID stays the stable game identity; credentials attach to that
  row (in-place upgrade preserves progress). On login from a fresh device the client **adopts the
  account's player row**; merging two non-trivial anonymous progresses is out of scope for v1.
- **Email: Amazon SES** (us-east-1, account `140065018525`), outbound only. Sender identity
  `vega.tenony.com`, from `noreply@vega.tenony.com`. A scoped IAM user (`vega-sentinels-mailer`, only
  `ses:SendEmail`/`SendRawEmail`) supplies keys via the server-only `.env` (like `DATABASE_URL`).
  - **SES is called via hand-rolled AWS SigV4 over the built-in `fetch`**, isolated in its own file
    (`server/src/ses.js`) — **no `@aws-sdk` dependency for now**, keeping the built-in-only ethos.
    **Future:** if SigV4-by-hand becomes a maintenance burden (more AWS calls, signing edge cases), we
    may add `@aws-sdk/client-ses` — the isolated module is the single swap point.
  - **✅ SES production access granted** (2026-06-21) — the account is out of sandbox, so verification
    emails can be sent to arbitrary player addresses (no per-recipient verification). Production access
    is account-level (shared with the TendNook/Salesforce project). Dev/test still works without creds
    (the `ses.js` no-creds path logs/records the link).

**Sequencing.** Like i18n, this adds a migration and touches `server.js` + `client/index.html` — land it
relative to the other in-flight features deliberately and coordinate migration numbers (don't let two
branches both grab the same `00N`).

---

## 12. Project name & domain — Vega Sentinels / vega.tenony.com

Renamed from the working title **Space Ninjas** to **Vega Sentinels** (Vega = a well-known star;
"Sentinels" = the player archetype, replacing the "ninja" theme). The player's in-game title becomes
**Sentinel** (was "Ninja"). Canonical domain **https://vega.tenony.com** (a subdomain of `tenony.com`),
which **replaced** `space.bagaiev.com` — the cutover has long since completed and vega.tenony.com is the
established production host.

**Why this name:** an exact "Vega Sentinels" is unclaimed on stores; bare star `.com`s are all long
taken, so we host on the `tenony.com` subdomain — store/trademark uniqueness matters more than owning
the `.com`. Both words are common individually ("Sentinels" especially; `Astra Sentinel` is a near
neighbour) — accepted as a working brand.

**Execution order:** the rename is done **first**, before auth/email — see
`docs/plans/rename-vega-sentinels.md`. It splits into **Phase A** (user-facing text + docs — small now
that i18n centralized strings into `client/locales/`) and **Phase B** (infra: the `spacegame`
container/image/Traefik router, the `space.bagaiev.com` host rule, `/opt/projects/spacegame`, DNS) — a
coordinated production/domain migration done with the deploy, not a text edit.

---

## 13. Between-level briefings — data-driven message + server-side actions

**Decision.** Progression beats (a story message + state changes) between levels are **data on the
level**, not hardcoded. A level descriptor carries an optional `briefing = { textKey, text, actions[] }`
shown when the player advances **into** that level (i.e. after clearing the previous one — "what's next").

**Actions run server-side, on advance, exactly once.** `advanceProgress` dispatches each action through a
typed switch (`replaceWeapon` today; `addCredits` / `addToStash` later). They mutate authoritative player
state (`player_ships.loadout` for a weapon swap), so they must be server-side — the client can't be trusted
and the change must persist. Because `current_progress` only moves **forward** (monotonic), advancing into a
given level happens once, so its actions run once; individual actions are also written to be **idempotent**
(`replaceWeapon` is a no-op if the `from` weapon isn't mounted), so a retry can't double-apply.

**Why on the *next* level (not an `onComplete` of the finished one):** the narrative is "here's a tougher
mission and a better weapon for it", which belongs to the upcoming level; it also means the last level needs
no briefing (there's no "next"). On a win the result overlay shows a **Continue** button (a loss shows
Restart/retry) that opens the **Hangar** screen — the between-battles screen (future home for ship
management) — which displays the returned briefing (large text) and launches the next level; the client
also reloads the active ship so the swap is visible.

**Side fix:** `buildPlayerFor` now uses the active ship's **persisted loadout/components** (it previously
always used catalog defaults), which is what makes a stored weapon swap actually take effect in-game.

---

## 14. Asset management (ship/weapon models)

**Split source from runtime.**
- **Runtime, committed:** only web-optimized `.glb` in `client/assets/<kind>/` (KB-scale). Served
  statically by Express, referenced from the DB by `model_url` (e.g. `assets/ships/player.glb`). The 5
  in-use ships (`player/fighter/rocketeer/heavy/boss.glb`) are 11–28 KB.
- **Source/heavy, NOT committed:** Blender files, downloaded packs, high-poly / 4k-texture originals go
  in `client/assets/**/_source/` — **gitignored**, local-only. Keep your own backup; they're not
  versioned (too big — would bloat git history forever). Moved the 7–31 MB originals
  (`lowpoly_spaceships`, `spaceship_colaid1_50k*`) there out of the served `ships/` dir.

**Why:** top-down arena game, ships are tiny on screen; 50k-poly / 4k-texture models (7–31 MB) are
overkill and kill browser load. Budgets: ~1–5k tris, textures ≤512–1024 px, file size tens of KB. Run
source → runtime through `gltf-transform` / `gltfpack` (Draco/meshopt + texture downscale) before
committing the runtime `.glb`.

**`model_url` indirection stays** — the DB points at a path/URL, so swapping/relocating a model is a
data change, not code. **Scale path:** when assets grow, host runtime `.glb` on **S3 + CloudFront** (AWS
account already in use) and point `model_url` at the CDN — deploys stop carrying asset weight, cache is
effectively permanent. `model_url` already accepts absolute URLs.

**A ship's look comes from its MODEL, never from a tint.** `applyShipModel` loads the `.glb` with
`tint: false` — the model's own materials/colors are what you see. **We do NOT recolor a ship by its
`stats.color`** (a brief experiment that tinted enemy models by `color` was reverted). When a design note
asks for a differently-colored enemy ("maroon medium", "crimson boss"), that means **author a model in
that color**, not set a `color` value. Consequence: enemies that currently *reuse* a base model
(`advanced_medium_pirate` → `heavy.glb`, `second boss` → `boss.glb`, `pirate gunner` → `fighter.glb`) look
like that base model until a distinct model exists — they're only mechanically different for now.
`stats.color` survives **only as metadata** for the off-screen edge markers + mini-map dots, the ship
explosion tint, and the placeholder primitive shown while the `.glb` loads — it never paints the model.

**Licensing:** every third-party asset's source + license goes in `client/assets/CREDITS.md` (packs in
`_source/` need their license verified before any runtime use).

**LOD per ship — combat (low) vs hangar (high).** A ship can carry two models: the tiny combat `.glb`
(`model_url`, loaded at game start) and an optional detailed hangar `.glb` (`model_url_high`, **lazy-
loaded only when the hangar opens**). Rendering one hi-poly hero model up close is no problem for
Three.js (the bottleneck is download size, not draw calls) — so the detailed model can be 100k+ tris
with PBR/IBL in the hangar, while combat stays minimal. Even the "detailed" model is optimized
(`gltf-transform` meshopt/Draco + KTX2 textures → ~1–4 MB, not the raw 7–31 MB originals).

**Heavy/hangar models are delivered via S3 + CloudFront, not git/deploy.** This is the first real use of
the CDN path: high-detail `.glb` are uploaded to an S3 bucket (`vega-sentinels-assets`, us-east-1) and
served through a CloudFront distribution (private bucket + Origin Access Control; CORS allows the app
origin). `model_url_high` points at the CloudFront URL. The app repo/deploy never carries these files;
cache is effectively permanent. The tiny combat `.glb` stay committed in `client/assets/` as before.

**Live CDN coordinates (provisioned):** bucket `vega-sentinels-assets` (us-east-1, public access
blocked) → CloudFront `d1843uwjdjg4vs.cloudfront.net` (distribution `E10277HTPK8ESK`, OAC
`E1V1952Q4QWOXJ`, cache policy CachingOptimized, origin-request CORS-S3Origin). Upload:
`aws s3 cp model.glb s3://vega-sentinels-assets/ships/<name>_hangar.glb` → URL
`https://d1843uwjdjg4vs.cloudfront.net/ships/<name>_hangar.glb`. A custom domain
(e.g. `cdn.vega.tenony.com` via ACM) can be added later.

**Asset pipeline (`docs/plans/ship-model-pipeline.md`) — partially implemented (2026-06-23).** How models
are sourced, optimized, stored and kept in sync:
- **No binaries in git — S3 is canonical** (revised from "commit the tiny combat glb"): high-poly
  **sources → S3 `source/`**, **combat low-poly → S3 `ships-combat/`**, **hangar high-poly → S3
  `ships-hangar/`** (served via CloudFront). The repo carries only **URLs/paths in the seed**, not bytes.
  (The handful of existing primitive `.glb` stay in git as a fallback; the pipeline is for real sourced
  models.)
- **Combat models are pulled onto the server at DEPLOY (CI), not runtime** — CI `aws s3 sync ships-combat/
  → client/assets/ships/` before `docker build`, baked into the image → runtime stays same-origin (no
  CORS / no startup S3 dependency; the blue-green healthcheck isn't gated on S3). Hangar high-poly stays
  lazy-loaded from CloudFront.
- **Content-hashed filenames** (`<ship>_combat.<hash>.glb`) — hash = version; caches forever, new model =
  new URL, no invalidation. Bytes on S3 + hashed URL in git ⇒ they can't drift.
- **Drift-check / deploy guard:** every pipeline `model_url*` in the seed must exist on S3 or the
  deploy fails (no ghost ships) — `npm run assets:check`.
- **Tooling:** local `npm run assets:build` (gltf-transform via npx → combat + hangar, content-hashed) /
  `assets:push` (→ S3, `claude_admin`) / `assets:pull` (S3 → local) / `assets:check`. Generation stays
  **local** (needs the source + human judgment on decimation). **Implemented:** the schema field
  `ships.model_url_high` (migration 012 / PG bootstrap); the four `scripts/assets-*.mjs` + root
  `package.json` scripts (build verified end-to-end); the scoped **read-only IAM user `vega-assets-ci-read`**
  (S3 `GetObject`/`ListBucket` on the bucket only — verified read-allowed / write-denied) with its access key
  stored as GitHub secrets `ASSETS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`ASSETS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; and the **CI deploy
  job** runs `assets:check` (guard) + `assets:pull` (S3 → `client/assets/ships/`, baked into the image)
  before the rsync/build, gated on the secret. All a **safe no-op today** (in-git primitives, empty
  `ships-combat/`). **Compression policy:** **combat glbs are built as light as possible for battle** —
  aggressive decimation **+ meshopt geometry compression** (the ship is tiny on a top-down screen, so heavy
  simplification is invisible); **hangar glbs keep full detail with meshopt + WebP**. Both use meshopt, so
  both need the client's `setMeshoptDecoder` (wired) to load; inspect either in a web glTF viewer.
  **First real sourced model shipped:** `enemy_1` (combat + hangar) is on S3 and wired to `basic enemy
  ship` (`model_url` + `model_url_high`) — the pipeline is proven end-to-end, not just a no-op.

**Model orientation is fixed in DATA (`stats.modelYaw`), not by re-exporting.** Our ships face `+Z`
(`makeShip`'s primitive nose); `applyShipModel` already auto-centers and auto-scales every loaded `.glb`
without trusting the asset's own transform, and **orientation joins that same set of runtime
normalizations**. A model exported facing the wrong way (the `enemy_1` combat+hangar pair was authored
nose-toward `-Z`, so the basic enemy flew engine-first) is corrected with a per-ship `stats.modelYaw`
(radians; `Math.PI` for `-Z`), threaded seed → `modelSpec(url, yaw)` → `applyShipModel`'s pivot. **Why
data over re-export:** one field corrects both the combat and hangar models (same source), needs no
Blender/source round-trip or S3 re-push, and survives swapping in a differently-oriented source later.
The knob is the documented escape hatch — it had silently regressed when ships went DB-driven
(`modelSpec` dropped `yaw`), which is how the bug shipped. **Prevention:** before `assets:push`, eyeball
the nose (= `+Z`) in a web glTF viewer (e.g. `gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com`), then confirm in-game (see
`client/assets/README.md`).

## 15. Hangar shop & stash (the "spend" side of the economy)

See `docs/plans/hangar-shop.md` for the full brief. Key choices:

- **Server-authoritative + transactional, from day one.** Buy/sell/equip/unequip all mutate credits +
  the persistent loadout via endpoints, each wrapped in a DB transaction (SQLite `BEGIN/COMMIT`; Postgres
  a checked-out client with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the balance). This is the first place real money is
  spent, so no client trust and no double-spend / item-dupe window — even under repeated/parallel calls.
- **Stash = qty model**, keyed by `(player_id, kind, ref_id)`, `kind ∈ {component, weapon}` (two separate
  catalogs / id-spaces). One-row-per-instance is deferred until items gain individual state (upgrades/wear).
- **Unlock gate = a `shop_unlocked` flag, not progress.** The shop opens only after the player **clears the
  final level**. `current_progress` can't move past the last level, so reached-vs-cleared the final level is
  indistinguishable from it — hence a dedicated flag, flipped when `advanceProgress` runs with no next level
  (advance is only POSTed on a win, so that *is* the clear). On the first flip we **backfill the basic gun
  (id 1)** into the stash, and `replaceWeapon` briefings now deposit the replaced weapon too; the backfill
  uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so the two paths converge to exactly one owned gun (uniform whether
  or not the deposit already ran).
- **Required slots block take-off, they don't block unequip.** `hull`/`engine`/`thruster` are required;
  `repair` + weapons are optional. We **allow** emptying a required slot into the stash but report
  `launchable=false` + `missingRequired` on the active-ship payload, and the client greys out Take-off. This
  is simpler than a launch endpoint (there isn't one — the client just loads the level) and keeps the server
  authoritative on the *config* while the client enforces the *gate*. Optional equipped items (weapons,
  repair drone) **sell directly** from the hangar (no unequip step); required ones can't be sold while
  equipped (would strand the ship with no replacement).
- **Weapons slot by fire-group, components by type.** A component's slot = its `type` (`hull`/`engine`/…);
  a weapon's slot = its fire-group (`bullet`→`gun`, `rocket`→`rocket`), replacing the first mount in that
  group (or appending). Enough for the single-gun/single-rocket player ship; multi-mount curation comes with
  real weapon variants. **Same-id equip is net-zero** (the displaced item is always returned to the stash,
  even when it equals the installed id) so it can never silently lose or dupe an item.
- **`price` seeded 0 (economy inert).** A top-level `price` column on `components` + `weapons` (sibling of
  `weight`); sell = `floor(price*0.75)`, server-computed. With everything at 0 the flows work (buy free, sell
  for 0); real prices + a curated/`buyable` shop list + around-model slot icons slot in later.

## 16. Pause — client-side freeze (revisit for multiplayer)

The pause button freezes the fight by **skipping the simulation `update()` in the render loop** (the frame
keeps rendering, so the scene just holds). It's a single-player convenience: cheap, no state to snapshot,
and it doubles as a **mobile auto-pause** when the tab/app loses focus (`visibilitychange`/`blur`, gated to
touch devices) so a backgrounded fight doesn't run on.

**This does NOT survive the move to multiplayer.** In a shared, server-authoritative world a client cannot
stop time for everyone — "pause" there is a different feature (e.g. a host/lobby pause, a per-player
ready/AFK state, or simply disabled in live matches), and the **mobile-blur auto-pause becomes a
disconnect/AFK concern**, not a freeze. So when multiplayer lands: **re-evaluate pause** — decide whether
it's host-authoritative, lobby-only, or removed in PvP, and replace blur-auto-pause with an AFK/grace
policy. Until then the client-side freeze is the right, simplest thing.

---

## 17. Mission set-pieces — procedural decor in the COMBAT scene, not collidable

Mission environments (research station, asteroid field, freighter) are the **near "battle environment"
we fight around**, so they go in the **combat `scene`, lit from above by the combat sun** — the same way
we see the ships. This contrasts with §5 (the **planet & moons** live in `skyScene`, lit by a distant sun
with a day/night terminator; **stars** are unlit): those are the far cosmic backdrop, the set-pieces are
local. They sit **just below the combat plane** (close, so you fly over them with strong parallax like the
background asteroids — tops ~20 below the ships so they don't poke through / occlude), with **`fog: false`**
materials so they stay readable. (They started ~500 below as a backdrop; pulled close on playtest feedback.)

Key call: **being in the combat scene does NOT make a mesh collidable.** Hit-tests and AI iterate the
**gameplay entity arrays** (enemies / bullets / rockets / player), never "everything in the scene" — so a
set-piece added as a plain visual mesh and **left out of those arrays** is pure decor: bullets pass
through, the AI ignores it. To make an element collidable later (asteroid cover, a destructible base),
register THAT element in the relevant gameplay array (scope B).

They're **procedurally generated in code** (no CDN/`.glb`, no license; like the planet/moons/primitive
ships) for now — swap to real `.glb` later (§14). Data-driven via a `setpieces` array on the **map**: there
is **ONE shared world** (`home-system`) holding all the set-pieces at fixed, far-apart positions, so they
exist on every level/mission. A side mission only changes **where you fight** — its `center` spawns the
player + arena over the matching structure; the others sit at a distance. (An earlier iteration built only
the active mission's set-piece at its center; the player asked for a single unified map differing only by
combat location, so they moved back into the shared world — spread far enough apart that they don't pile
up.) They're rebuilt each run so the cruising freighter resets. The **off-center / drifting-arena** coupling is
**implemented**: the soft boundary/warp/mini-map compute relative to a movable `arenaCenter` (a side
mission sets it to its `center`); a descriptor `drift` `{x,z}` can also pan it with a `sync` set-piece
following — but **set-pieces are static today** (no mission turns drift on; it's for a future escort
mission). Three builders exist: `research-station`,
`asteroid-field` (irregular/cratered rocks + a mining station + a particle mining beam), and `freighter`
(fiery exhaust). See `docs/plans/mission-maps.md`.

---

## 18. Side missions — generated level descriptors, repeatable, no story advance

A "mission" **reuses the level engine**: it's the same `{ title, map, phases[] }` descriptor the campaign
uses, played by the same client `levelRunner` — emitted by a generator (`server/src/missions.js`) instead
of hand-authored. No new runtime. The board offers **three flavors** (mining / research / freighter) that
are **identical in difficulty/composition** and differ only in flavor text (i18n) — *not* Easy/Med/Hard
tiers (a deliberate call from `docs/plans/mission-generator.md`).

Two decisions worth recording:
- **Side missions don't advance the story counter** (`current_progress`). They're repeatable grind for
  credits to fund the shop; the descriptor carries `sideMission: true` and the client's `win()` banks the
  per-kill ×2 credits (via the existing `/api/games`) but **skips `unlockNextLevel()`**. Campaign levels
  still advance as before.
- **Reward = per-kill ×2, like a level** (2a). The generator is **stateless** and returns full descriptors
  inline; the client plays them directly. **Server-sealed per-mission rewards** (so the payout can't be
  forged) are deliberately deferred to the **integrity backlog** — it only matters once the sim isn't
  client-trusted (PvP). The endpoint is still server-owned + gated by `shop_unlocked` (same gate as the
  shop), so the *offering* is authoritative even though the reward isn't sealed yet.

The **UI is provisional**: 3 buttons top-right + a description panel (not the eventual richer hangar board).
Enemy mix/difficulty (the pirate gunner + the boss MG buff + the 2-boss finale) is
`docs/plans/mission-enemies-difficulty.md`. Richer objectives + per-mission set-piece environments + reward
sealing are later slices.

## 19. Player-data reset — per-player DELETE vs full wipe, kept out of the catalog path

**Decision.** Two explicit reset operations, implemented per-backend (`resetPlayer` /
`resetAllPlayers` in `db.js` + `db_postgres.js`) and driven by a CLI (`server/src/reset.js`) +
a `reset-progress` skill — rather than the ad-hoc "delete `server/data/game.db`" we used before.

- **One player** uses targeted `DELETE … WHERE player_id = ?` on the player-scoped tables plus an
  `UPDATE players` back to the new-player baseline, then re-grants the starter ship. The **account,
  auth columns, active `sessions` and language preference are deliberately kept** — "reset progress"
  should leave the player able to log straight back in. It is *not* a row delete of `players`.
- **All players** clears every player-scoped table and lets the **catalog** (`ships`/`weapons`/
  `components`/`maps`/`levels`) re-seed on the next startup — never deleting catalog rows, consistent
  with the seeding-is-upsert rule ("Catalog seeding" in SUMMARY). SQLite has no `TRUNCATE`, so it
  uses `DELETE` + a `sqlite_sequence` reset; Postgres uses `TRUNCATE … RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`
  (one atomic statement, FK order handled by `CASCADE`).

**Why not just delete the DB file?** That only works for local SQLite, loses the schema, and has no
production analogue. Backend-symmetric functions work identically against prod Postgres, are unit-
testable, and keep the destructive "all" path behind an explicit `--yes`. Backend is auto-selected by
`DATABASE_URL`, so the same command is safe locally (SQLite) and intentional in prod (only if set).

---

## 20. Camera zoom — scale the offset, not FOV / camera swap

**Decision.** Zoom multiplies the fixed `CAM_OFFSET` vector along its existing angle (clamped
`0.6–2.2×`, persisted in `localStorage`), rather than changing the camera FOV or swapping camera type.
This preserves the game's defining camera character — near-vertical, rigidly player-attached, no
rotation (DECISIONS on the fixed camera) — so the change is minimal and can't distort the view. Inputs
are platform-tuned: **PC** = wheel + ＋/− buttons, **mobile** = ＋/− buttons + two-finger pinch.

**Why offset-scaling.** FOV zoom warps perspective and the perceived ship size non-uniformly; a camera
swap (e.g. orthographic) would change the whole look. Scaling the offset just slides the same camera
nearer/farther along its fixed ray — identical framing, only the distance changes.

**Pinch vs. the steering stick.** Pinch listeners are on the canvas (`renderer.domElement`) and counted
via `e.targetTouches`, which only includes fingers targeting the canvas. The stick lives in its own
`#stick-zone` element (left 58%, `pointer-events:auto`) that captures its own touches, so a stick
finger is never counted toward the two-finger pinch. The wheel listener is likewise on the canvas, so
on menus (where the hangar/welcome DOM overlays the canvas) the wheel scrolls the shop instead of
zooming.

**Amendment 2026-07-04 (see §42).** Pinch listeners **moved off `renderer.domElement` onto `#stick-zone`**,
which now covers the **whole play area** (`inset:0`), not left 58% — because the stick zone would otherwise
swallow the two-finger touches it used to leave for the canvas. The `e.targetTouches` scoping is
**unchanged** and is exactly why a finger held on **FIRE/rocket** (sibling targets with their own handlers)
isn't counted toward pinch, so holding FIRE while steering is preserved — that reasoning still holds, only
the host element changed. Separately, the mobile zoom `+`/`−` buttons **no longer fire on a synthesized
`click`** (which the browser suppresses while a second touch point is active, so they were dead during
flight) — they fire on **`touchstart`** like FIRE/rocket; the `click` path is now mouse-only.

## 21. Color/lighting tuning — a dev tool (`?tune`), not a player setting

**Decision.** Dialing in the space-backdrop palette + lighting is done with a **dev-only** lil-gui panel
gated by `?tune` (dynamically imported inside the guard, so players never fetch it and the default build
is unchanged), **not** a player-facing brightness slider. The panel gives per-element control
(background, fog, sky ambient/sun, combat ambient/sun) and a "Dump palette → console" export of exact
`0x`-hex/intensity values, which are then **baked** into the seed/code by hand. A narrow, clamped player
"space brightness" setting can come later, but the dev panel is a prerequisite for choosing its safe
range anyway.

**Why.** A player slider can only move 1–2 global knobs, can't pick specific colors or read off exact
values, and risks washing out bullets/exhaust/markers against the carefully-tuned near-black palette —
which would break the two-pass lighting invariant (§5: combat and sky are lit by separate scenes so
ship readability is independent of the backdrop). The dev tool gives exact, per-element control with
zero combat-readability risk and produces paste-ready values. Fog + combat lights are still hardcoded in
`index.html` (sky/background already live in the `catalog_seed.js` map descriptor); a later refactor can
make the whole palette data-driven so the dump is one object to paste (color-tuning.md Step 4, deferred).

## 22. Audio — procedural Web Audio (synthesized SFX + generative music), no asset files

**Decision.** Game audio is **fully procedural**, built on the **native Web Audio API** — no library, no
audio files, nothing on the CDN, no licensing. SFX are **synthesized** (oscillators + filtered white
noise + gain envelopes); the background music is **generative** (sustained pad triads + an arpeggio over
a slow Am–F–C–G progression, scheduled with a look-ahead timer). It lives in `client/src/audio.js`.

**Why procedural (not Howler / not real files), resolving the two ROADMAP open questions:**
- **Native Web Audio over Howler.js** — same reason as every other dependency call in this project
  (built-in `node:sqlite`, hand-rolled SES SigV4, canvas planet textures, code-generated set-pieces): the
  browser API is enough and adds zero deps. Howler mainly buys autoplay-unlock + buffer juggling, which we
  don't need without files.
- **Synthesis over sourced audio files** — keeps the "**no binaries in git**, procedural-first" ethos
  (DECISIONS §14/§17). Real SFX/music would mean sourcing + **licensing** (CC0/CC-BY tracked in
  `CREDITS.md`), an audio sprite, and hosting on S3+CloudFront — real infra/curation work for a feedback
  prototype. Synthesis ships **immediately, in one PR, with nothing to find or host**. The trade-off is
  fidelity: the music is atmospheric/ambient, not a scored track, and SFX read "arcade" — acceptable (often
  fitting) for a top-down space shooter. (The user, unfamiliar with game-audio sourcing, chose this after a
  walkthrough of the three options — procedural / hybrid / all-files.)

**Swap path (kept open).** Every call site goes through `audio.sfx.*` / `audio.setScene(...)`, and all
sound flows through named buses (`sfxGain`, `musicGain`, an internal `moodGain` for the scene crossfade).
Replacing the generative music with a **real track is "add a `BufferSource` on `musicGain`"** — no call-site
changes. So the **hybrid option (procedural SFX + a real music file on the CDN)** remains a small follow-up
when a licensed track is chosen, without rework.

**Mechanics worth recording:**
- **Autoplay policy (cross-browser):** the `AudioContext` is created **lazily on the first user gesture**.
  Browsers disagree on which event counts — **Chrome accepts `pointerdown`; Safari (esp. iOS) ignores it
  for audio**, wants `click`/`touchend`/`keydown`, and stays suspended until a node actually *plays* in the
  gesture. So `unlock()` plays a one-sample **silent "kick" buffer** (the standard Safari wake), and the
  client listens on **all of `pointerdown`/`touchend`/`click`/`keydown` and retries on every gesture until
  `isReady()`** (rather than detaching after the first, possibly-rejected, attempt). Importing the module
  never touches the DOM/AudioContext, so it's safe under `node:test` (pure settings helpers are tested; the
  engine is browser-only). *(This was the cause of an initial "no sound on macOS/Safari" report.)*
- **Mix safety:** a `DynamicsCompressor` on the master bus + a **polyphony cap** (skip new SFX past ~28 live
  voices) keep machine-gun fire and stacked explosions from clipping. Enemy fire is low-passed and
  **distance-attenuated** so a swarm doesn't drown the player's own gun.
- **Music = game state:** `combat` mood (faster, with a bass pulse) during a live fight; `hangar` mood
  (slow, sparse) on menus / overlays / while paused. Transitions duck-and-switch over ~1 s.
- **Settings:** Master/Music/SFX **volumes** + Music/SFX **on-off toggles**, persisted to `localStorage`
  (keys `audio*`) and applied live. The audio-only **settings modal** (a ⚙ gear on the welcome/hangar
  screens + while paused) is the project's first dedicated settings menu; language/zoom intentionally stay
  where they are for now (scope kept to audio).

**Amendment (2026-06-23) — the swap path is now partly realized: a sampled SFX layer.** The synth stays the
default, but a weapon can now opt into a **real recorded sound**. Why hybrid-for-SFX (not just music): the
user disliked the synthesized gun reports and preferred sourcing real shots; samples and synth coexist on the
same `sfxGain` bus, so the mix safety (compressor + ~28-voice cap) and call sites are unchanged. Mechanics:
`audio.preloadSamples(map)` decodes content-hashed mp3s into a buffer cache (loaded once after unlock from
`client/src/sfx_manifest.js`); `sfx.shoot(kind)` plays the named buffer as a `BufferSource` with a subtle
per-shot pitch jitter (rapid machine-gun fire reusing one clip would otherwise sound robotic), and falls back
to the synth zap when the buffer is absent — so a missing/failed asset is never a hard error. Routing is
**data-driven**: a weapon's `stats.sfx` key (in `catalog_seed.js`) flows to the runtime weapon as `w.sfx`,
read at the fire site — no client hardcoding. **Distribution** reuses the ship-model pipeline (DECISIONS §14):
the mp3 bytes are content-hashed, pushed to S3 (`sfx/`), pulled same-origin into `client/assets/sounds/`
(gitignored, no binaries in git), and verified by the `assets:check` deploy guard. **Extraction stays manual
/ agent-driven** ("a source file + a comment" → pick + clean the shot with ffmpeg) rather than an automated
splitter, since judging which take and how much reverb tail to keep needs an ear. First sound: a CC0 glock
shot (Freesound) on the kinetic guns. Format **mp3** (smallest, universal `decodeAudioData`). Full process:
`docs/plans/audio-sample-pipeline.md`.

**Amendment (2026-06-24) — SFX routing normalized into DB tables (sound classes).** With more sounds it
became clear the client shouldn't name them inline ("100 different ships"). Routing now lives in two seeded
tables: **`sounds`** (`key → url + gain`) and **`sound_map`** (`(entity, class, event) → key`); each ship/
weapon carries a **`stats.class`**, and the client resolves at runtime via `sfxFor(entity, class, event)`
(fetched from **`GET /api/sounds`**). **This supersedes the manifest** — `client/src/sfx_manifest.js` is
gone; key→url is the `sounds` table (URL changes now need a re-seed/deploy, fine because volume is baked
into the files). Chosen the normalized tables over a per-entity field (owner's call) so adding ships/weapons
never edits client code. Full design + schema: `docs/plans/sound-classes-and-mapping.md`.

**Amendment (2026-06-24) — generative music dropped for sampled looping tracks.** The generative synth
music (chord-progression scheduler) is **removed**; background music is now **real looping mp3 tracks**,
one per scene, routed through the same `sound_map` under **`entity: 'scene'`** (so it's data-driven like
SFX, as the owner asked). The map allows **multiple tracks per scene** (PK widened to include `sound_key`)
played at **random** (no immediate repeat); the engine crossfades on scene change and loops a lone track.
Why drop generative entirely (owner's call): with curated tracks it added nothing and was dead code. The
"procedural-first / no asset files" stance in this section is now firmly relaxed for audio — both SFX and
music are curated CC0 samples on S3, the engine keeps only the synth SFX as a per-sound fallback.

## 23. Performance quality tiers — High / Balance / Performance

**Decision.** A player-facing **graphics quality** selector (3 tiers) in the settings menu, persisted in
`localStorage` (`gfxTier`). The knob table + persistence live in a pure, tested module
`client/src/graphics.js` (mirrors `audio.js`). **Default High** for everyone, except a **touch device's
first run defaults to Balance** so a phone doesn't open in the heaviest mode.

**Why this, and what each tier changes.** Profiling intuition: the perf overlay shows `draw 74 · tris
66k` — both trivial even for an entry mobile GPU. The real bottleneck on a weak phone (e.g. Galaxy A14)
is **fragment fill rate**: `setPixelRatio(min(devicePixelRatio, 2))` renders at up to 2× resolution, the
scene is drawn in **two full-screen passes** (sky + combat, §5), and **additive particles**
(explosions/sparks/exhaust/shockwave/bright-star glow) multiply overdraw. So the tiers turn the
fill-rate knobs, not geometry: **pixel-ratio cap** (2 / 1.5 / 1 — the dominant lever), **antialias** (on
/ off / off), **star density** (×1 / .6 / .35), **particle density** (×1 / .6 / .4 — fewer sparks, drops
the 2 middle fireball layers + the shockwave ring, thins the per-frame exhaust). Draw calls and triangle
count are deliberately **not** touched — they aren't the bottleneck.

**Applied via reload (not live).** Picking a tier saves it and **reloads the page**. The first cut tried
live-applying pixel ratio + density while leaving antialias for "the next reload" — but `antialias` is a
`WebGLRenderer` constructor argument (can't change on a live renderer), and rebuilding the GL context
mid-game is messy (re-uploading textures, and the zoom/pinch listeners live on `renderer.domElement`, so
a new canvas would lose them). The half-applied state was also confusing on a phone — a tester on a
Galaxy A03s reported "switching quality doesn't change anything," partly because antialias (a real cost)
never turned off without a manual reload. Reloading is the simplest guarantee: on startup the renderer is
built with the tier's `antialias` + `pixelRatio`, and `buildMap`/particle spawns read the tier's
star/particle scales from the start. Server-side progress is untouched, so a reload just returns to the
welcome/hangar. **Measurement caveat (documented for testers):** FPS is vsync-capped (≈60) and the
settings gear **pauses** the fight, so the perf overlay reads ≈60 on every tier *in the menu* — the
tiers' benefit is fewer dips below 60 in heavy combat and less thermal throttling over time, observed
**during gameplay**, not a higher peak in the paused menu.

**Follow-up (2026-06-25): `renderScale` + a particle ceiling + a resolution readout, after a tester
reported the same 15-25 fps in *combat* on BOTH High and Performance.** That is the key datum: dropping
Performance from High is a ~4× pixel cut (pixelRatioCap 2→1) plus AA/envMap/particles off, yet combat fps
didn't move. Two hypotheses survive: **(1)** the device's `devicePixelRatio` is ~1, so `min(DPR, 2)` and
`min(DPR, 1)` are *identical* — the cap never reduced pixels — or **(2)** the frame is **CPU-bound** (the
per-frame `update` + the DOM HUD/markers/minimap work, or the fixed two-pass overhead), where resolution
is irrelevant. The change tests both, measurement-first:
- **`renderScale`** (tier knob, Performance 0.7; 1.0 = off on High/Balance) multiplies into
  `setPixelRatio`, rendering the backbuffer **below native** and letting the browser upscale the
  full-size canvas. It is the **only** lever that bites *below* a pixelRatioCap of 1, so under hypothesis
  (1) it is the first genuine fill-rate test. Chosen over a second render-target sky pass (a "Lever B" in
  the plan) because it is one multiply, zero new GL objects, and no risk of a stale-sky parallax judder —
  build the costlier sky throttle only if idle fps stays low *after* this.
- **`maxParticles`** (Performance 300; `Infinity` off on High/Balance) is a hard ceiling on live additive
  particles (exhaust trail + sparks) — new emits are skipped over budget. Cuts both overdraw and
  per-frame JS, so it also helps under hypothesis (2). Layered on top of the existing `particleScale`.
- **Resolution readout:** the perf overlay now appends the real backbuffer size
  (`renderer.domElement.width×height` = CSS × pixelRatio × renderScale). A tester can now see whether a
  tier/renderScale change moved the pixel count *at all* — directly distinguishing hypothesis (1) from
  (2). Both knobs (and a possible 4th "Potato" tier) stay deferred-until-measured; see
  `docs/plans/perf-low-end-phones.md`.

**Follow-up #2 (2026-06-25): a `?dev` perf monitor + `perf_samples` telemetry — we were flying blind.** A
second tester (Redmi 10c) reported fps **independent of the graphics tier AND of scene load**: High gave a
*higher* fps than Performance (impossible if our knobs were the bottleneck — almost certainly a test-order
thermal artifact), and brief dips happened while simply turning with nothing on screen, not during a heavy
fight with two explosions + a station. That is the signature of **external governing** — thermal/DVFS clock
scaling + browser frame-pacing (vsync/compositor) + occasional GC — none of which our settings touch. A
single vsync-capped fps number can't prove it, so we built a measurement tool:
- **`?dev` (dev-gated, like `?tune`/`?debug`)** turns on `devPerf` in `index.html`: each frame it times the
  JS work in three buckets — **`update`** (the sim), **`dom`** (HUD + markers + minimap + OOB overlays),
  **`render`** (the two-pass `renderer.render` *submit* cost; true GPU exec is async and not directly
  measurable in a browser — `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` is disabled on mobile) — and once a second emits an
  aggregated sample (see SUMMARY for the shape) with a one-time device/GPU passport. **Off → zero overhead**
  for normal players (the per-frame `performance.now()` marks are guarded by the `DEV` flag).
- **The decisive read:** if `js.total` is far below `frameMs.p50` (e.g. 6 ms of JS in a 28 ms frame), the
  frame is **not CPU-bound** → it's external/GPU-governed and *no graphics setting will move it much*; if
  `js.total ≈ frameMs.p50`, it's **CPU-bound** → cut per-frame JS (throttle the DOM overlays, profile
  `update`). The `device.gpu` string finally tells us the real chip.
- **Storage:** a **dedicated `perf_samples` table**, not the funnel `events` table — perf samples are
  higher-volume, structurally different, and shouldn't pollute the funnel's allowlist/indexes or be wiped
  by a player reset. **`POST /api/perf`** is write-only over HTTP (no public read route); analysis is plain
  SQL. Sampling is once/sec, batched every ~5 s (+ `sendBeacon` on tab-hide) to avoid the monitor itself
  adding jank. We give a friend a `/?dev` link and read the rows later.

**Verdict from the first real capture (2026-06-25, ~500 samples, PowerVR Rogue GE8320 / A03s-class):** the
data settled the question — **this device is governed externally (GPU driver / thermal-DVFS / compositor),
not by anything our render path controls.** Three independent proofs: (1) **Performance renders 7× fewer
pixels than High** (597×268 vs 1601×720 — `min(dpr,1)×0.7` vs `min(dpr,2)×1.0`) yet **fps is unchanged** →
*not* fill-rate bound, so resolution levers (renderScale, a sky-pass throttle) can't help here; (2) **fps is
uncorrelated with scene load** (140 draws → 41 fps, 60 draws → 20 fps) → not draw/particle bound — the same
load yields wildly different fps across thermal windows; (3) **heap is flat at 11-18 MB** (limit ~1020) →
no memory leak / GC pressure. Steady-state JS is cheap (`update` 1.8 ms, `dom` 1.8 ms); the only sizeable JS
chunk is the **render submit ~12 ms**, and even that doesn't scale with draw count. **Consequence: stop
adding graphics tiers / fill-rate levers for this class — they're proven ineffective.** **Lever B (sky-pass
throttle) is cancelled** (fill rate isn't the wall). **`renderScale` was REMOVED (2026-06-27):** the initial
verdict kept it ("harmless, marginally cooler"), but on review it only **blurred the image for zero fps gain**
(the 5.5-7× pixel cut on Mali/GE8320 changed nothing), so it's a pure quality regression — gone. The resolution
levers that remain (`pixelRatioCap`, `antialias`) are kept as cosmetic-quality knobs, not perf knobs. The one real, addressable defect the data exposed is **startup**: the first 1-4 frames of
every session spend **0.8-2.2 s** in render submit (shader compilation + texture upload). **Confirmed on a
second device** (Mali-G52 tablet: ~0.4 s first-frame spike, but otherwise a healthy 44 fps vs the GE8320's
26 fps — and the same fill-rate-independence: a 5.5× pixel cut moved its fps by nothing either). So the
startup hitch is the one cross-device win — **now built** as a shader pre-warm (next paragraph).

**Shader pre-warm (built 2026-06-25).** `prewarmShaders()` compiles both scenes (`renderer.compile`) plus
two throwaway off-screen meshes that match the dynamic effect program keys (additive fog-off for
particles/explosions; opaque fog-on for bullets/rockets), so those programs are ready before the first
spawn instead of compiling lazily mid-fight. **Runs once, deferred two `requestAnimationFrame`s** after the
loop starts (a synchronous compile on the critical path would block first paint), during the menu — where
the player ship + sky already compile behind the welcome screen anyway. **Gated off under the `?debug`
inspection hook:** `renderer.compile` is very slow on the headless visual suite's software GL (swiftshader)
and, even deferred, blocked the main thread enough to flake the startup-sensitive scenarios (`01-smoke`,
`03-exhaust-trail` — proven: 5/5 clean vs ~2/8 flaky with prewarm on). Prewarm is perf-only and behaviorally
inert (it compiles shaders that would compile anyway), so skipping it under the test hook costs the suite
nothing; real users always get it. On-device effect is validated via the `?dev` first-sample render time.

**Measurement fix (same day):** `frameMs`/FPS were fed the sim's **clamped** `dt` (`min(getDelta, 0.05)`),
so `frameMs` saturated at 50 ms and the overlay FPS was *overstated* on slow devices — every GE8320 session
read `frameMs.max = 50` exactly. The perf path now reads the **raw** `clock.getDelta()`; the sim keeps the
clamp. (GPU execution time is still not directly measurable — `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` is disabled on
mobile — but a low `js.total` against a high *raw* frame interval is enough to localize "not our JS".)

**Particle batching — tried (2026-06-27) and REVERTED the same day.** The one data-supported CPU lever
(draw-call submit): trail + sparks were batched into one `THREE.Points` cloud each (Performance only). The
`?dev` telemetry was unambiguous: it **lowered per-particle draw cost** (~0.9 → ~0.5 draws/particle) but
**combat fps didn't move** (~22-24, governor-capped) and **`js.render` rose ~1 ms** with particles present —
the dynamic Points fields re-uploaded their whole buffer every frame (`needsUpdate` on the full capacity,
not the live range), which on this weak GPU cost more bandwidth than the handful of draw calls it saved.
Net: a custom-shader Points system + an un-prewarmed shader hitch for **zero measurable gain**. **Removed**
(per "if you reverted it, remove it"); the mesh-per-particle path is restored everywhere. This is the **5th
independent proof** that the GE8320's *combat* fps is set by its GPU/compositor governor, not anything we
render: (1) 7× pixel cut, (2) load-independence, (3) tier-independence, (4) flat across the whole tier table,
(5) a real draw-call reduction — all moved combat fps by nothing. **Conclusion: stop optimizing this
device's combat fps; the ceiling is hardware.** The shippable wins were the **shader pre-warm** (startup
freeze) and **`renderScale` removal** (sharpness) — both perceptible, both kept.

## 24. Wing-bank on turn — an inner "bank" group, not `rotation.z` on the root

**Decision.** The cosmetic wing-roll (ships tilt into a turn, capped 20°) is applied as
`bankGroup.rotation.z` on a **dedicated inner group** that holds each ship's visual children, **not** by
writing `rotation.z` on the ship's root group. The root keeps owning only `rotation.y` (heading),
position and scale. Roll is derived from the **actual per-frame heading change** (vs `turnRate*dt`), so
one code path (`updateBank`) covers keyboard, touch, warp-back and enemy AI turning. Cosmetic only —
no gameplay reads it.

**Why.** The root already carries `rotation.y = heading`; setting `rotation.z` on the *same* object makes
the final orientation depend on Euler order (yaw and roll would interact, and a roll could subtly skew the
heading the sim trusts). A child group whose local Z is the ship's forward axis (ships face `+Z`) gives a
**pure roll about the nose** that composes cleanly with the parent's heading yaw and the model's `model.yaw`
pivot — independent axes, no order risk. The primitives **and** the loaded `.glb` live in this group (so a
ship banks whether or not its model has loaded), and the spawn-grow / warp-back scale animations write the
**root** scale, so roll and grow don't interact. The sign (roll *into* the turn) was confirmed by eye /
the `13-ship-bank` visual scenario.

## 25. Per-ship model presentation — a grouped `stats.model` block, not loose keys

**Decision.** The per-ship model-presentation knobs live in **one JSON sub-object** `stats.model`
(`{ yaw, scale, scaleMul?, muzzle?, exhaust? }`) in the seed, not as loose top-level `stats.*` keys.
`yaw`/`scale` are the renames of the old `modelYaw`/`sizeScale`; `muzzle`/`exhaust` are new optional
overrides for the projectile/exhaust spawn point (group-local units, same as `userData.noseZ`/`tailZ`;
`null` → auto-derive from the glb bounds). The client resolves it through `shipModelCfg(s)`, which still
**falls back to the old loose keys** if `stats.model` is absent.

**Why.** Discoverability + a documented onboarding path: a grouped block has one place to look and one
doc (`docs/plans/adding-a-ship-model.md`) describing every knob, so adding a model is "fill this block,
no code reading"; future model-only knobs land here instead of growing the flat `stats` namespace. The
back-compat fallback costs nothing and protects against a stale/legacy `player_ships` row or a cached
`/api/ships` response carrying the old keys — so the migration of all 8 seed ships can't break an
already-loaded client. Muzzle/exhaust units are **group-local** (independent of `scale`, which is
re-applied at spawn via `mesh.scale.x`) so they read like the primitive's ±1.6 reference.

## 26. Force landscape on phones by rotating the whole body 90° (not a cover, not `orientation.lock`)

**Decision.** On a touch device held in **portrait**, the entire `<body>` is rotated 90° in CSS
(`body.rot`, `transform: translateX(100vw) rotate(90deg); transform-origin: top left`) and the game runs in
the **swapped** dimensions, so it renders horizontally on the portrait screen. `applyOrientation()` (boot +
`resize`/`orientationchange`) toggles the class and is the single place the renderer/camera are sized — to
`gameW()/gameH()` (innerHeight/innerWidth swapped when rotated). Pointer/touch coords are mapped into the
rotated frame by `toGame()` (the algebraic inverse of the transform); pinch distance is rotation-invariant.
The single Full-screen button is **gated to touch menus** (`body.touch.menu`) and a `fullscreenchange`
listener hides it once fullscreen (`body.fs`).

**Why.** Three options were considered: (a) a "rotate your device" cover, (b) `screen.orientation.lock`,
(c) CSS-rotating the content. (b) is not portable — it needs fullscreen and is **unsupported on iOS
Safari**, so iPhones would still render the landscape-tuned HUD squashed into portrait. (a) works
everywhere but is a dead-end screen the user must act on. The maintainer chose (c): the browser physically
cannot make its viewport wider than the screen, so the *only* way to actually play in landscape on a
portrait-held phone is to rotate the content — which (c) does, with no extra tap. The cost is real but
contained: the renderer/camera must size to swapped dims and touch math must be un-rotated (`toGame`), both
centralized so the rest of the code is oblivious. A key bonus: when auto-rotate is on and the user turns the
phone to true landscape, `rotated` flips to false and the **native** landscape viewport takes over
seamlessly — the CSS rotation only fills the held-portrait / rotation-locked case. The earlier cover +
`orientation.lock` + auto-pause-on-portrait approach was removed entirely (there's no unseen portrait fight
to pause once the game itself is landscape). The button stays menu-gated because the bottom-right corner is
the **rocket button** mid-fight; re-entering fullscreen is a menu-time action anyway.

*Open follow-up:* the rotation direction (game-top lands on the screen's right) is a one-line flip
(`translateY(100vh) rotate(-90deg)` + invert `toGame`) if it reads backwards on a real device.

## 27. Main Window redesign — drop "Hangar"; a fixed landscape layout with a dedicated ship preview

**Decision.** The between-battles / landing screen (formerly the **Hangar**) became the **Main Window**:
a fixed CSS-grid landscape layout (top bar | left menu | work zone | 25% ship-model preview) instead of a
centered, vertically-scrolling column. Two sub-decisions are worth recording:

**(a) The "Missions" menu unifies the campaign briefing with the side missions.** The old UI split them —
the campaign briefing was the big centered hangar text + Take-off, while the three side missions were a
separate top-right button board opening a modal. The redesign folds both into **one left-menu list**: the
campaign mission as the **primary** row, the side missions as **secondary** rows; selecting any row renders
its description + Take-off into the work zone. *Why:* they are the same kind of thing (a launchable mission
descriptor played by the `levelRunner`) presented two different ways; one list is simpler to build, one
work-zone renderer (`renderMissionView`) serves both, and the top-right corner frees up for the (inactive)
"Ships" entry. The old `#mission-btns` board + `#mission-panel` modal were deleted, not hidden.

**(b) The ship preview is a dedicated mini Three.js view, not a hole punched in the menu to the battlefield.**
The combat scene renders *behind* the menu's opaque gradient; showing the ship in the right 25% could either
(i) make that region transparent and position the player ship in the live scene, or (ii) render a separate
small scene. We chose **(ii)**: `#mw-ship` gets its own `WebGLRenderer` + scene + camera + light + a fresh
RoomEnvironment PMREM, loads the player's `_hangar` glb, and auto-rotates — its rAF loop gated to Main-Window
visibility. *Why:* (i) entangles the menu with the battlefield camera/arena state and the parallax backdrop
for a simple "turntable" of one ship; (ii) is self-contained, reuses the existing hangar glbs (no new asset
→ no `CREDITS.md` change), and is trivially start/stoppable so it costs nothing in a fight. The known cost is
a **second GL context** on weak phones; if profiling shows it hurts, the fallback is a **scissored second
viewport on the existing renderer** (same context), not a new renderer. See
`docs/plans/main-window-redesign.md`.

**Naming.** "Hangar" was dropped from on-screen text and from the code/DOM/i18n identifiers
(`showHangar`→`showMain`, `launchFromHangar`→`launchCampaign`, `openHangarShop`→`openBay`, `#hangar`→
`#mainwin`, `#hangar-go`→`#mw-go`, …). The i18n **string keys** (`ui.shop.*`, `ui.hangar.default`) were left
alone — renaming keys ripples through every locale file for zero user benefit. The death-overlay button keeps
`ui.gameover.back_to_hangar` for the same reason.

## 28. Item (component/weapon) 3D models — hangar-only icons, reuse the ship pipeline & prefix

**Decision.** Components and weapons get the **same** `model_url` / `model_url_high` columns + `stats.model`
convention as ships, fed by the **same `assets:*` pipeline**. But we wire **only `model_url_high`** (the
hangar/CloudFront glb) and leave `model_url` (combat/same-origin) null, and the item hangar glbs reuse the
existing **`ships-hangar/`** S3 prefix rather than a new `items-hangar/` one.

**Why.** Items are **never rendered in the combat scene** — there they're part of the ship — so an item
model is a **menu-only icon** (shown spinning in the preview). Wiring the combat path would mean baking item
glbs into the deploy image (the CI `ships-combat/` pull/bake step) for no gameplay use, and a new S3 prefix
would mean pipeline surgery (`assets-config.mjs` + push/check) for what is just "another high-poly menu glb".
So we reuse the ship machinery wholesale and only paste the hangar URL. The build still *emits* the unused
combat glb (harmless). Minor naming wart (a machine-gun glb under `ships-hangar/`) accepted over churn;
flagged as a future cleanup. The hangar **ship preview** was generalized to a ship-or-item viewer
(`setPreviewModel`) rather than standing up a second Three.js context. See
`docs/plans/component-weapon-models.md`.

## 29. Briefing item showcase — server-derived `showcase {kind,id}`, client-derived on reload

**Decision.** A level briefing that **grants gear** shows that item's spinning 3D model in the preview. The
server attaches a **`showcase {kind,id}`** to the briefing it returns, **derived from the briefing's own
grant actions** (`replaceWeapon`→weapon, `installComponent`→component; an explicit `briefing.showcase` in the
seed overrides). It sends only `{kind,id}` — not a model URL — because the client already has the catalog
(with the URLs). The **client also derives** the same `{kind,id}` from the briefing `actions` on the
page-reload landing path.

**Why.** The hard constraint: a briefing's `actions` run **server-side** and the advance response
deliberately strips them, returning only `{textKey,text}` — so the client can't, by itself, know what an
*advance* granted. Deriving `showcase` from the actions server-side (single source of truth, no seed
duplication) and shipping `{kind,id}` solves that without a new endpoint (it rides the existing response).
The reload-landing path is different: there the client receives the **raw level descriptor** (which still
carries `actions`, but no server-computed `showcase`), so the client derives the same mapping itself — one
small helper makes **both** entry paths show the item. Sending `{kind,id}` (not the URL) keeps the server
ignorant of asset URLs (they live in the catalog/seed the client already loads). See
`docs/plans/briefing-item-showcase.md`.

**Update (placement).** The granted item now renders in a **dedicated viewer in the work zone**
(`#mw-item`) at **full size** (`ITEM_SHOWCASE_SCALE = 1`), **not** in the right-column ship preview — the ship
preview keeps showing the player's ship at all times. The original plan (decision #2 in
`briefing-item-showcase.md`) put the item *in* the right preview, replacing the ship; the maintainer asked
for the item beside the briefing text **without** displacing the ship. **Layout (final):** the canvas is
**floated into the bottom-right corner of the mission text, with the text wrapping around it** — it lives
**inside `#mw-mission-desc`** next to a `#mw-mission-text` span and a 0-width strut (`#mw-item-strut`), both
floats preceding the text in source. Bottom-right-with-wrap is the **classic CSS strut-float trick**: the
strut floats right with `height: calc(100% − var(--gun-h))` to reserve the **top** of the right column (text
flows full-width past the 0-width strut), then the canvas `clear: right` drops **below** it into the
bottom-right corner — the text then wraps full-width above the item and down its left side. (A plain
`float: right` can't anchor to the bottom; absolute positioning would pin the corner but kill the text wrap —
the strut gives both.) Earlier iterations were rejected by the maintainer: a full-width block stacked above
Take-off **stole the description's vertical space and pushed the mission text off-screen on phones**; a
half-width `flex` block (bottom-left, then bottom-right) **occupied a full horizontal band** instead of
tucking into the corner. The viewer
machinery was factored into `buildModelViewer`/`startViewer`/`stopViewer`/`resizeViewer` +
`setViewerModel(viewer,…)` so the same code drives **two** small GL contexts (ship preview + item showcase);
the second is built lazily and its rAF loop is stopped on launch / when the bay view hides the mission
canvas, so it costs nothing outside an active briefing.

## 30. Keep processes simple until a real problem forces otherwise (YAGNI for workflow)

**Decision.** When designing *workflow / tooling / process* (not just code), default to the **simplest
thing that works for how we operate today**, and only add structure once we've hit a concrete problem —
or a problem is clearly, imminently likely. We deliberately do **not** pre-build for hypothetical future
scale.

**Why.** Recorded while designing the multi-agent development pipeline (`docs/plans/multi-agent-pipeline.md`,
the `feature-pipeline` skill + planner/critic/implementer/reviewer agents). Two concrete calls made under
this principle:
- **Feature IDs = timestamp prefix `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug`** (e.g. `2026-06-30-1612-laser-cannon`), used for
  the plan filename, git branch, worktree dir, and CHANGELOG bucket. We **rejected** a sequential-number +
  shared `REGISTRY.md` ledger: sequential numbers only collide under *parallel allocation*, which is a
  multi-author concern, and the ledger added moving parts (allocation commits, `[skip ci]` hygiene,
  rebase-before-write) we don't need yet. A timestamp is collision-free for a single author and needs no
  central state.
- **Single-author assumption is explicit.** We are not onboarding other developers now; when that changes,
  *that* is the trigger to revisit ID allocation, locking, and review gating — not before.

**How to apply.** Before adding a registry, a locking scheme, a queue, a config layer, an abstraction, or a
multi-step process step, ask: *which real, present problem does this solve?* If the answer is "a future one
that may not arrive," don't build it — note it as a future trigger and move on. This applies to the agents
and the pipeline skill themselves: grow their rubrics from **actual** feedback (the retro step), not
speculation.

## 31. Client split into native ES modules — buildless, no bundler

**Decision.** Break the ~3500-line inline `<script type="module">` in `client/index.html` into cohesive
ES modules under `client/src/`, loaded **natively by the browser with no build step**. `three` keeps
coming from the CDN **importmap** in `index.html`; each module does `import * as THREE from 'three'` and
the browser resolves it through that same importmap. The server keeps serving `client/` as plain static
files — no Vite, no bundler, no transpile in CI/deploy.

**Why.** The project ethos is plain static hosting (the server just `express.static(clientDir)`); adding a
bundler would put a build artifact between source and what ships, plus a build step in CI and deploy that
doesn't exist today. Native ESM over HTTP/2 is fine for our size (the modules are small, same-origin; the
one CDN fetch for `three` is unchanged). The cost — many small module requests — is acceptable now; if
startup latency ever measurably regresses we can revisit Vite *then*, not speculatively (see §30).

**The `G` state-bag pattern.** Native ESM shares an exported `const` array/object **by reference** (mutating
its contents is visible everywhere) but an exported `let` scalar is a **read-only view** in importers (you
can't reassign it from another module). So: entity collections + the catalog are exported `const` in
`state.js`; **reassigned cross-module scalars** (`player`, `gfx`, `sky`, `stars`, `arenaDrift`, …) live as
properties on a single mutable bag `export const G = {…}` — write `G.player = …`, read `G.player`. Scalars
are promoted onto `G` lazily, as the domain that owns them is split out, rather than all up front. Engine
singletons (`renderer`/`scene`/`camera`/lights) are exported `const` from `engine.js`.

**Rollout.** Incremental — one safe slice per commit, the existing unit + visual suites green between each
(the visual suite asserts on simulation state and zero page errors, so a broken import surfaces immediately).
See `docs/plans/client-code-structure.md` for the slice sequence and the target module layout.

---

## 32. Password reset is enumeration-safe (always 200), auto-verifies + purges sessions

`POST /api/auth/forgot-password` **always** returns `200 { ok:true }` and the client shows an identical
"if that email has an account, a reset link is on its way" confirmation **whether or not the email exists**.
This means the endpoint can't be used to probe which emails have accounts (a login/register endpoint that
distinguished "no such account" would leak that). The accepted cost: a user who mistypes their email gets
no "no such account" feedback — they just never receive the mail. Standard practice, and consistent with
DECISIONS §30 (keep it simple).

The emailed `/?reset=TOKEN` link, when consumed, **marks the email verified** — clicking it already proves
the player controls that inbox, so requiring a separate verification afterward would be redundant. Reset
also **invalidates every existing session** for the account (`deleteSessionsForPlayer`) before opening a
fresh one for this device: if the reset was prompted by a compromised/leaked session, that session is
killed as a side effect.

**Residual timing side channel (accepted).** A request for an *existing* email awaits the SES round-trip
(and the scrypt-free token store) before responding 200, while a *non-existent* email returns almost
immediately — so response latency can still leak account existence to a determined observer. We accept
this: it mirrors the existing verification/resend flow, and closing it (async-queueing the send, or padding
to a constant-time response) isn't worth the added complexity per §30. Revisit if abuse appears.

## 33. itch.io "Online" export — a static client pointed at the prod API, bearer auth, reflect-any CORS

We ship an **itch.io HTML5 export** as an *online* build: a static ZIP served from itch's CDN that calls
the **existing production backend** at `https://vega.tenony.com`. Several sub-choices:

**Online build, not an offline bundle.** itch serves only static files, so a fully offline build would need
the whole server + DB bundled client-side (a second codebase) and would carry no shared progression. Pointing
the static client at the existing prod API reuses one backend and one player database — guest and account
progress sync with the web deploy. The cost is a hard runtime dependency on `vega.tenony.com` being up, which
is already true for the web deploy, so it's acceptable.

**Bearer tokens over `SameSite=None` cookies for cross-origin iframe auth.** A third-party cookie inside an
iframe is blocked/unreliable across modern browsers regardless of `SameSite=None; Secure`, and flipping the
primary same-origin deploy to `SameSite=None` would weaken its CSRF posture for no gain. Instead, login/
register/reset **also** return the raw session token in the JSON body; the client stores it in
`localStorage['authToken']` and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`, which `sessionTokenFromReq` accepts
(header first, then the cookie). This works cross-origin deterministically. Trade-off: a `localStorage` token
is XSS-exposed like any SPA token — accepted (game progress only, no sensitive data). The change is
**additive**: the cookie path is untouched for the same-origin site, and no `db.js`/`db_postgres.js` change
was needed (the token, its SHA-256 hashing, and the session table already exist), so SQLite/Postgres parity
holds by construction.

**Reflect-any CORS is safe here because credentials are off.** The `/api` CORS middleware reflects the
request `Origin` and deliberately does **not** set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`. With bearer (not
cookie) auth cross-origin and no credentials allowed, reflecting an arbitrary `Origin` can't be leveraged
for a credentialed cross-site request, so an allowlist of itch's *rotating* CDN subdomains
(`*.itch.zone`/`*.hwcdn.net`) would add maintenance for no security benefit.

**API base is baked at build time, not detected at runtime.** `client/src/api-base.js` exports `API_BASE`
(empty = same-origin); `scripts/build-itch.mjs` overwrites only the *staged* copy with the prod origin. No
hostname sniffing (itch's rotating subdomains + empty `file://` hostname make runtime detection fragile), no
query-param/config toggle. The build uses the system `zip` binary (no new dependency) and is manual, not
wired into CI (§30). Guest play always works on itch via the localStorage `playerId`; account login now works
via the bearer token.

---

## 34. Client device support — two independent axes (`input` / `form`), phased over two iterations

**Decision.** Replace the single `isTouch` boolean with a two-axis device model in one module
(`client/src/device.js`): **`input` = `touch | mouse`** (capability, ~constant per session — drives
interaction-bound behavior: touch controls, auto-pause on blur, fullscreen-on-tap, hover-vs-tap reveal)
and **`form` = `phone | tablet | desktop | desktop-lg`** (derived from the viewport's longest edge,
recomputed on resize — drives layout/CSS + forced rotation). Each axis has a single source of truth and
projects onto mutually-exclusive body classes (`input-touch|input-mouse`, `dev-phone|dev-tablet|
dev-desktop|dev-desktop-lg`); `body.touch` is kept as a compatibility alias so existing touch CSS isn't
rewritten. Breakpoints (longest edge): `phone < 900 ≤ tablet < 1280 ≤ desktop < 1920 ≤ desktop-lg`.

**Why two axes.** `isTouch` conflated capability with size. New profiles (tablet, foldable, big monitor)
are almost entirely a *form* concern, not an *input* one. Separating them means a resize recomputes only
`form` (it never re-inits touch controls), and adding a profile = one `classify()` rule + its CSS.

**Why two iterations.** Iteration 1 (this change) builds the architecture + a set of desktop-browser CSS
fixes to the Main Window ONLY. It deliberately does **NOT** implement full resize-driven adaptation of
every screen — that is iteration 2. The structure is built so iteration 2 drops in cleanly: `form`
already recomputes on resize/orientationchange (via `applyDevice()` inside `applyOrientation`), and
layout keys off `body.dev-*`, never raw `isTouch`. Guard rail: right structure now, full adaptation
deferred — not over-built, not under-built.

**No `isTouch` re-export from `engine.js`.** The plan allowed one "for back-compat", but every consumer
(`state.js`, `sim.js`, `mainwindow.js`, `welcome.js`, `main.js`, `engine.js` itself) migrated to
`Device.hasTouch`, so a re-export would be dead code (§30). `canHover` (`matchMedia('(hover: hover)')`) is
exposed on `Device` for iteration 2 but **not** wired to anything yet — the shop `(i)`/hover reveal stays
on the `body.touch` alias for now.

## 35. Perf overlay is dev-only, reusing a sticky `?dev` flag (not a new one)

**Decision.** The top-center FPS/service string (`#perf`) is a **diagnostic tool**, not player-facing game
info, so it's **hidden by default** (`#perf { display: none }`) and revealed only for developers via
`body.devmode:not(.menu) #perf`. Rather than invent a new flag, it **reuses the existing `?dev` flag**
(which already gates the `devPerf` perf telemetry) — one shared source of truth, `client/src/dev.js` /
`isDev()`, drives the overlay visibility, the `●dev`/JS-heap suffix, and the telemetry. The flag is made
**sticky in localStorage** (`devMode`): a truthy `?dev`/`?dev=true`/`?dev=1` turns it on and remembers it;
an explicit `?dev=false`/`?dev=0` turns it off and clears it; no `dev` param → the stored flag decides.

**Why.** Players never asked for a load meter; showing it clutters the HUD and confuses. Reusing `?dev`
avoids a second flag to reason about (cf. §21, the `?tune` dev-tool convention) and keeps things simple
(§30 — no new endpoint, no in-game toggle). Sticky-with-off-switch means a developer types `/?dev` once
instead of re-appending it every load, while `?dev=false` gives a clean, explicit way out. The
tri-state parse also **drops the old loose `location.search.includes('dev')`** substring match (which
matched `?developer` and any `…dev…` param). `?tune`/`?debug` stay independent — `?dev` doesn't umbrella
them.

**Class name.** The reveal class is `body.devmode`, deliberately **not** `body.dev`: the device-profile
classes already use a `dev-` prefix for *device form* (`body.dev-desktop`/`body.dev-phone`, §34), so a bare
`body.dev` would conceptually overload that prefix. `devmode` keeps the diagnostics gate unambiguous.

---

## 36. Admin panel — env-gated HTTP Basic Auth (404 when unset); referrer as one opaque JSON column

**Decision.** The `/admin` dashboard (server-rendered players + per-player game aggregates) is protected by
**HTTP Basic Auth** with credentials from the server `.env` (`ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, compared with
`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) — **no admin user table, no bespoke login page, no session**. When either env var
is unset the route returns **404** (admin disabled — indistinguishable from "no such route"), so it is never
wide open on prod even if someone forgets to configure it. The referrer captured per player is stored as
**one opaque nullable `TEXT` column** (`players.referrer`, a compact JSON string of `document.referrer` +
`?ref=`/UTM), **written once on row creation** and never overwritten, **not** parsed into per-param columns.

**Why.** For a single maintainer eyeballing "who registered and how they play" (§30 — keep it simple), Basic
Auth over TLS is the least machinery that is safe: the browser handles the credential prompt, there's no
new auth surface to maintain, and the 404-when-unset default fails closed. A dedicated admin account
model / RBAC would be gold-plating for one operator. The referrer is for **eyeballing, not querying** —
funnels/UTM analytics are out of scope — so a single verbatim JSON blob (truncated to 512 chars, rendered
raw in the panel) avoids schema churn and per-param columns that nothing yet reads. **Write-once at INSERT**
(never on the `last_seen` UPDATE) gives "first-referrer-only" for free and means the many later auto-register
calls (active-ship/level/games) can keep passing no referrer. Basic Auth is also written to guard any future
`/api/admin/*` JSON endpoints, though none are added now. `/admin` is mounted **outside `/api`**, so the
`/api`-scoped CORS never applies — it stays same-origin only.

---

## 37. A prod model/asset hash change also needs a `publish-itch` (itch bundles glbs, reads catalog live)

**Context.** The itch.io export (§33) is an *online* build: its ZIP **bundles the combat `.glb` files**
(served same-origin from itch's CDN) but fetches the **ship catalog LIVE** from `vega.tenony.com`
(`API_BASE` baked by `scripts/build-itch.mjs`). Those two facts are independently sensible but **coupled**:
the bundled glbs are a point-in-time snapshot, the catalog is always current.

**Consequence (the bug this documents).** When a model changes on prod via the ship-model pipeline (§14),
its **content hash changes**, so the live catalog immediately serves the *new* hash. The already-published
itch ZIP still contains the *old* glb, so the itch client requests the new hash from itch's CDN → **404 →
generic primitive cone** for exactly the changed ships (other ships are unaffected). This bit us on the
basic-pirate metallic-hull change (2026-07-02): the fighter + pirate gunner showed cones on itch until
re-published.

**Decision.** Any model/asset change that reaches prod is **not done until the itch build is re-published**
too — run `/publish-itch` (`assets:pull` → `build:itch` → `butler push dist/itch-staging
bagaiev/vega-sentinels:html5`) after the prod deploy. This is now step 11 + a checklist item in the
`update-ship-model` skill and a lesson in the feature-planner's guidance, so it can't be forgotten.

**Alternatives rejected.** (a) *Rewrite `modelUrl` to absolute prod/CDN URLs in the itch build* so itch
always pulls the exact glb the live catalog names — would make itch immune to this drift, but adds a
build-time URL rewrite + a hard runtime dependency on the prod origin (or CDN) for *every* combat model
(today they're same-origin/offline-cacheable on itch), and re-introduces CORS for model fetches. Deferred
as over-engineering (§30) until model changes are frequent enough to justify it. (b) *Bundle the catalog
into the itch ZIP too* — kills shared progression / live balance updates, the whole point of the online
build (§33). So the accepted cost is a manual re-publish step, enforced by the skill + planner guidance.

## 38. First `.glb` set-piece — standalone loader in `world.js`; the exhaust made server-configurable

**Context.** The "save the transport" freighter was the project's only fully procedural mission set-piece
(a stack of `BoxGeometry`: spine + bridge + window + 4 cargo containers + engine block + 4 nozzles). We
replaced its hull with a real sourced `.glb` (CC-BY "Freighter - Spaceship"), keeping the animated fiery
particle exhaust.

**Decisions.**
1. **The freighter is the first `.glb`-backed set-piece.** Every other set-piece stays procedural; this is
   the one that gains a model. It loads `freighter_combat` (auto center/scale/`yaw`-oriented like a ship
   model), with the exhaust built synchronously so a trail shows during the async load — and **no
   procedural-box fallback** (on load error the exhaust just keeps running).
2. **Standalone loader in `world.js`, not shared with `applyShipModel`.** `makeFreighter` reuses only the
   exported shared `gltfLoader` instance (so meshopt-compressed combat glbs decode) plus the same
   `Box3` center/scale/`yaw` normalization pattern — but writes its own small load path. `applyShipModel`
   is coupled to combat-ship semantics the freighter doesn't share (`bankGroup`, tint, `SHIP_MODEL_LEN`
   normalization, `noseZ`/`tailZ` userData for muzzle/exhaust spawn), so generalizing it would add coupling
   for one caller. Kept simple (§30).
3. **The fiery exhaust became a spec/server-configurable effect.** Its palette (`hot`/`mid`/`end`) and
   particle params (`count`, `len`, `size`, `speed`) are read from an **optional `exhaust: {…}` object on
   the set-piece spec** in `catalog_seed.js`, delivered to the client via the existing map descriptor
   (server → `/api/maps/:name` → `buildMap` → `makeFreighter`), falling back to the current hardcoded fiery
   look. This is the deliberate, **light** seed for future server-driven model effects — **no** effect
   registry, multiple effect types, or generic abstraction was built (§30). Because the exhaust is built
   synchronously but the model loads async, the emitter origin (`emit` `Vector3` + `spread` scalar) is
   **mutable**: the loader overwrites it from the model's real group-local rear bounds once resolved, and
   the update loop reads it each frame — so fire streams from behind the actual engines.

**Alternatives rejected.** (a) *Generalize `applyShipModel`* to serve both ships and set-pieces — rejected
as coupling for a single extra caller (see decision 2). (b) *Build an effect framework now* (effect
registry / multiple effect types / per-particle turbulence) — rejected as speculative gold-plating (§30);
made only the one existing exhaust spec-configurable with safe defaults.

## 39. Autopilot + return-to-base mission end

**Context.** Every mission (campaign L1–4 + the three repeatable side missions) used to win the instant the
last enemy died — which for side missions ended awkwardly far out at the mission zone, and gave the shared
world's base station nothing to *do*. We added a **base station** `.glb` set-piece at the world origin `(0,0)`
and made **all** missions end by flying home to it.

**Decisions.**
1. **One `levelRunner` intercept covers everything.** Both campaign levels and side missions play through the
   same `levelRunner` (`sim.js`). The `win` phase's `this.win()` is replaced by `this.beginReturn()`, so *every*
   `event: 'win'` phase becomes return-to-base with **no per-level or per-descriptor edits**. The phase's existing
   `delay` (watch the boss explode) still runs first; the return prompt appears after it. Rejected: per-mission
   descriptor fields — needless duplication.
2. **The station is below-plane, NON-collidable decor** (maintainer's explicit call), like the freighter (§17):
   no hit-tests, no gameplay array, ships fly *over* it. It is raised closer to the plane than the freighter
   (center `y = -42` vs the freighter's `-48`) so it reads clearly top-down. The source model is tall
   (y ≈ 0.78 of its longest axis), so with `BASE_STATION_LEN = 100` the normalized half-height is ~39; at
   `y = -42` the station's **top sits at ~y = -2.9**, safely below the ships' `y ≈ 0.6` (§17 — set-piece tops
   stay below the ships so they never occlude). NB: the plan's strawman defaults (`LEN 160`, `y = -30`) would
   have breached the plane at `y ≈ +32`; the implementer lowered them per the §17 check. "Reached" = **horizontal
   (xz) distance to `(0,0)` ≤ `BASE_ARRIVE_RADIUS` (45u)**, just inside the station's ~50u footprint half-width.
3. **The dock is a mandatory explicit station click.** Proximity **alone never wins**. Victory requires
   `G.autopilot.active` (set **only** by the station click via `engageAutopilot()`) **and** the ship within
   `BASE_ARRIVE_RADIUS`. `checkArrival()`'s `!G.autopilot.active` guard is load-bearing: it means a manual or
   *cancelled* approach never completes the mission — the player re-taps the station to resume the dock. Standing
   next to the station without clicking never finishes; clicking while already inside the radius completes on the
   next frame. This also makes any spawn-on-station insta-win impossible. Rejected: a proximity auto-win (would
   fire on a manual fly-by / spawn overlap).
4. **Autopilot uses a kinematic symmetric-decel brake.** The passive release-brake (`IDLE_DRAG`) is *exponential*
   decay (`vel *= 1 − 0.8·dt`) — it asymptotes and never fully stops — so a literal "brake at the midpoint" can't
   stop cleanly at the station. Instead autopilot: (1) brakes to a full stop, (2) rotates the nose to face the
   station, (3) accelerates at max, then (4) begins a **constant-rate brake (decel == thrust `accel`)** once the
   remaining distance ≤ the stopping distance `v²/(2·accel)`, so velocity reaches ~0 right at the station.
   Rejected: the literal brake-at-midpoint (can't stop under exponential drag).
5. **Any control input cancels autopilot** (literal reading): movement (`W/S/A/D`, arrows, touch stick), fire
   (`Space`/FIRE), and rocket (`F`/🚀) — the same frame, control returns to the player. The station tap is a
   canvas raycast, ignored on HUD buttons (separate DOM elements over the canvas).
6. **Enemies spawn around `arenaCenter`, not the hero** (`ship-build.js`, same 70–130u ring) so waves originate
   at the mission zone even after the player wanders. See the §2 amendment.
7. **The OOB warp-back is lifted after the last kill** (`&& !G.returnToBase`) — required so a side mission fought
   far from `(0,0)` can fly the full distance home instead of being warped back mid-return.

A translucent **blue** homing arrow (anchored to the ship, re-pointed at the station each frame) + a centered
**"Sector cleared — return to base"** HUD hint (i18n `ui.return.hint`) show from the last kill until victory.

**Amendment (2026-07-03):** the station was moved off the world origin to **`(-20, -42, -20)`** (screen top-left
of the arena center) for composition. This is safe because the dock/win never hard-codes `(0,0)` — `checkArrival`
measures the horizontal distance from the player to `G.baseStation.obj.position` (the station's live position),
and the homing arrow already points at that object. So references to "`(0,0)`" above should read as "the station's
position". `pos.y` is unchanged (−42), so the §17 vertical-extent guarantee still holds.

## 40. Grab (tractor) component + enemy equipment drops — units, no hulls, victory-only, client-trusted

**Context.** Added a light loot loop on top of the kill→credits economy: enemies sometimes drop a piece of
their gear as a metal-box, a new **Grab** component pulls in-range drops to the ship, and collected drops
deposit into the Stash. A handful of design calls were resolved up front (see the plan
`docs/plans/2026-07-03-1412-grab-tractor-drops.md`).

**Decisions.**
1. **World units, not a "cell" abstraction.** Grab **range = `strength`** (units) and **pull speed =
   `(strength/2)·(10/itemWeight)`** (u/s). Concrete formulas over an invented grid: light parts pull fast
   (weight 2 → 25 u/s at strength 10), heavy parts slow, and a zero/missing weight falls back to 10 so the
   sim never divides by zero (defensive — the audit found no weightless item).
2. **The base grab's short range (10) is intentional; the Advanced grab (20) is the real tractor.** The base
   is a "vacuum assist" that snaps loot in over the last few units (enemies die ~14–25 units away, so you
   still fly most of the way onto it); the upgrade is the incentive. Not a bug — do not "fix" it.
3. **`REFERENCE_MASS` bumped 48 → 50 to absorb the base grab's weight.** The player now auto-owns the base
   grab (weight 2). Leaving `REFERENCE_MASS` at 48 would knock ~4% off the documented baseline accel 10 /
   turn 2.0; setting it to the new starter-loadout sum (50) keeps `massFactor = 1` at the baseline. A
   **deliberate neutralization, not a silent nerf** — the player's feel is unchanged.
4. **Hulls are NEVER droppable.** `pickLoot` draws only from the enemy's engine/thruster components + mounted
   weapons — never `e.hull`. A looted 550-HP boss hull would be equippable-from-stash and wreck progression.
   Engines/thrusters/weapons stay both droppable **and** equippable (accepted under infinite inventory +
   §30 — no further equip gate).
5. **Drops deposit on VICTORY only.** Collected loot banks into the Stash only when the mission is won
   (`levelRunner.win` → `depositLoot`); on death or restart the haul (and any un-grabbed drops) is lost.
   Parallels how credits bank at run end, but stricter (credits bank on death too). No despawn timer, no
   mid-mission persistence — nothing about a run persists until it's won.
6. **Pirate parts priced with `stats.buyable:false`.** Enemy components/weapons gained a resale `price` so
   looted gear sells for `floor(price·0.75)`, but a `buyable:false` flag keeps them **out of the shop** (the
   client filter hides them). A boss hull must never be buyable; this gives resale value without opening
   enemy gear for purchase. (The server `buyItem` doesn't enforce `buyable` — it's a client-shop concern —
   which is fine since no UI path offers those items.)
7. **Client-authoritative loot (roll + deposit).** The 20% roll and the pull run client-side; the victory
   deposit is a trusted client call (`POST /api/players/:id/loot`). A modified client could forge loot —
   the same posture as unsealed rewards (§18). Server-side sealing is deferred; the limitation is noted, not
   fixed. The endpoint is **not** shop-gated (loot is earned in combat, independent of the shop unlock).
8. **One shared metal-box model, single URL source of truth.** Every drop reuses one `DROP_MODEL_URL` (in the
   import-free `drops-config.js`, so `assets:check` validates it and node tests import the pure
   `pullSpeed`/`pickLoot` without pulling in THREE). No per-component drop models, no contested-loot/
   multiplayer authority, no inventory cap, no dedicated pickup SFX asset (a tiny synth blip) — all §30.

**Alternatives rejected.** (a) *A "cell" grid for range/speed* — rejected for concrete world-unit formulas
(decision 1). (b) *Make hulls droppable with an equip gate* — rejected; excluding hulls from the pool is
simpler and closes the exploit outright (decision 4). (c) *Server-side roll/sealing now* — deferred as an
integrity item, consistent with §18 (decision 7). (d) *Deposit loot on death too* — rejected to keep a real
stake on surviving the mission (decision 5).

**(Grab pull model superseded by §57 — the flat `range = strength` radius + distance-independent pull speed
described in decisions 1–2 above were replaced by an inverse-square field with emergent, weight-independent
range; the strength values, weight-scaled speed, hull/deposit/pricing decisions here still hold.)**

## 41. Autopilot generalized to a typed target (station or loot drop); win gated to the station

**Context.** Extends §39/§40. To make loot chests one-click reachable (click a chest → the ship flies over
and the passive Grab collects it), we needed a "fly-to-a-point" behavior — which the return-to-base autopilot
(§39) already is. Rather than build a second parallel fly-to system, we **generalized `G.autopilot` to carry
a typed `target`**: `{ kind:'station' }` (the return-to-base dock) or `{ kind:'drop', drop }` (a specific
loot drop). `autopilotControl` resolves the target's world position each frame and cancels cleanly if a drop
target vanishes (collected by the Grab, or cleared on reset — the `drops.includes(tgt.drop)` liveness check).

**Decisions.**
1. **The win is gated to the station target, not just "autopilot active".** With a chest-aimed autopilot able
   to run during return-to-base (a chest can overlap the station's arrive radius), `checkArrival`'s old
   `G.autopilot.active` guard was no longer sufficient — a chest fly-in could trip the dock. The dock/win now
   goes through a pure predicate **`canDock(autopilot, dist)` = active AND `target.kind==='station'` AND
   `dist ≤ BASE_ARRIVE_RADIUS`**. A chest-aimed autopilot is **structurally incapable** of winning the mission,
   at any distance. Rejected: a second, separate "grab autopilot" variable — more state to keep in sync, same
   brake/rotate/cruise code duplicated.
2. **Pure, unit-tested predicate module.** `BASE_ARRIVE_RADIUS` + `canDock` moved out of `sim.js` (not
   node-loadable — it imports THREE/engine) into an import-free **`client/src/autopilot-config.js`** (mirrors
   `drops-config.js`), covered by `autopilot-config.test.js` — the "a drop never docks" invariant is the one
   correctness-critical piece and now has a test, without needing a headless sim harness.
3. **A collected/removed drop cancels the autopilot** (ship coasts to a stop, control returns) — no
   auto-chaining to another chest, no hand-off to the station (§30: the simplest thing that reads well).
   `target` is cleared everywhere `active` is reset (`start`, `win`, the manual-cancel, the internal cancels,
   and defensively in `reset()`), so no dangling drop reference survives a run.
4. **Discoverability is client-only cosmetics:** a `cursor: grab` hand on chest hover (mouse only, mirrors the
   §39 dock cursor; chest wins over station on overlap), a near-chrome **glint** material tweak on the drop
   glb + fallback box, and **green off-screen edge arrows** (own pool, nearest 6) reusing the enemy-marker
   projection math. No new asset (glint is a runtime material change), so no `CREDITS.md`/publish-itch.

## 42. Touch input unified as tap-vs-drag over the whole canvas (10px slop), not a fixed left-58% stick zone

**Problem.** The old `#stick-zone` (`left:0; width:58%; pointer-events:auto`) claimed the entire left region
for steering and **swallowed every touch there**, so on-screen objects (loot chests, the return-to-base
station) were **untappable across most of the screen** — the desktop click-to-fly (chest/station raycast)
had no touch equivalent on the left ~58%.

**Decision.** Expand `#stick-zone` to the **full play area** (`inset:0`) and disambiguate **per gesture by
movement slop**: a single-finger gesture that never travels **>`TAP_SLOP = 10px`** from its touchstart point
is an **object TAP** that reuses the desktop click's raycast (factored into one shared `engageObjectAt` — a
live chest wins over the station on overlap), while a gesture beyond 10px becomes the **floating steering
stick** for the rest of that gesture. Objects and steering both work **anywhere** on screen. The pure
classifier (`exceedsSlop`) lives in `client/src/tap-gesture.js` and is unit-tested.

**Why 10px, distance-only.** Matches platform touch-slop conventions (Android `ViewConfiguration` ~8dp,
Hammer.js 9px). No time cap (§30 — simplest): a hold-still-then-release still counts as a tap, and time is
only needed for long-press/double-tap, which we don't have. Slop is measured in the **rotated game space**
(`toGame` coords), the same space the stick center and its ~12px dead zone live in, so the two thresholds
are apples-to-apples on a rotated phone.

**Trade-offs accepted.** (a) The stick base/knob is **shown on touchstart**, so a tap may briefly flash it
(deferring the visual until the threshold was rejected as extra state for no real gain). A ≤10px tap never
engages steering — it's inside the dead zone and `dragged` gates it. (b) Taps and steering now share the
whole surface, so the **2nd finger is reserved for pinch** (no tap-while-steering). Pinch **moved from
`renderer.domElement` onto `#stick-zone`** (the canvas no longer receives the touches) but still counts
**`e.targetTouches`** (per §20), so a finger held on FIRE/rocket (sibling targets) isn't counted — holding
FIRE while steering is preserved. `=== 2` (not `>= 2`) keeps today's pinch feel.

**Zoom `+`/`−` during flight — the real cause, found by reproduction (not the z-index keep).** The full-screen
zone would cover the rocket/zoom buttons, so `#rocket-btn`/`#zoom` are raised to `z-index:6` — a **necessary
companion**, but reproduction on a Playwright+CDP multitouch touch harness showed the buttons were **already
dead during flight before that**: the player steers with one finger, and tapping `+`/`−` with a second thumb
did nothing. **Root cause:** the buttons fired on a synthesized **`click`**, and the browser **only
synthesizes a click for a single-touch tap** — it suppresses the compat click while a second touch point (the
steering finger) is active. **Fix:** the zoom buttons fire on **`touchstart`** (mirroring FIRE/rocket, which
always worked during flight); the `click` path is kept **mouse-only** (empirically, the compat click still
fires alongside `touchstart` in some browsers even after `preventDefault`, which would double-zoom a lone
tap). Verified empirically that the zoom visibly changes when tapped mid-flight on touch.

**Alternative rejected.** Keep the 58% zone and add tap detection only on the right 42% canvas — that leaves
objects untappable on the left, which is the whole bug.

## 43. Nebula sky: bake procedural GLSL once to a cubemap (vs live per-frame shader-sphere vs third-party cubemap assets)

We wanted a real nebula backdrop without a per-frame cost or a shipped binary asset. **Live
shader-sphere** (an fbm fragment shader drawn every frame behind the fight) was rejected: the two-pass
sky/combat split (§5) already pays a full sky pass each frame, and a 6-octave fbm over every background
fragment is exactly the fill-rate work weak phones can't spare. **Third-party cubemap PNGs** (the CC0
StumpyStrust evaluation set we trialed) were rejected: they add shipped binary weight, a `CREDITS.md`
attribution obligation, and can't be re-tinted per-map. **Chosen:** render the procedural shader **once**
into a `WebGLCubeRenderTarget` at `buildMap` time and use it as `skyScene.background` — per-frame cost
collapses to a flat background draw (identical to today), the look stays fully procedural +
palette-driven from the descriptor, and nothing ships as an asset. The one-time bake is **tier-gated**
(Performance keeps the flat color — a 6-face shader bake can hitch the weakest phones, matching the
"Performance strips premium visuals" line from §23) and **skipped under `?debug`** (software-GL bake is
slow/flaky and would churn visual baselines — same reasoning as the `prewarmShaders` skip). The bake
`ShaderMaterial` must set `depthTest`/`depthWrite: false` (with `side: BackSide`): the bake runs under the
engine's global `renderer.autoClear = false` and `CubeCamera.update` doesn't clear the shared depth buffer
between the 6 faces, so with default depth test the stale face-0 depths would reject later faces' fragments
and bake the wrong direction. The sRGB output path makes the baked cube read slightly brighter/greyer than
a raw-canvas preview; the maintainer accepted the baked in-engine result as the baseline.

## 44. Full-screen affordance shown over live combat (not menus-only), gated by `body.menu`, with a foreground `body.fs` re-sync

**Context.** On a phone, backgrounding the browser and returning silently drops the tab out of
fullscreen — the address bar/chrome reappears — but the floating `⛶` button (and, on iPhone, the
Add-to-Home-Screen pill) was CSS-gated to **menus only** (`body.touch.menu`), so mid-battle the player had
no way to re-enter fullscreen and was stuck with a shrunken screen. Two bugs compounded: (1) the menus-only
gate, and (2) `body.fs` (which hides the button once fullscreen) was only re-synced on `fullscreenchange`,
an event mobile browsers frequently **don't deliver to a backgrounded tab** — so after restore
`document.fullscreenElement` is `null` but `body.fs` stuck true, hiding the button exactly when it was
needed.

**Decision.** Surface the fullscreen affordance **whenever the HUD/menu is up — active combat AND pause,
not just menus** — as long as we're not already fullscreen. Reuse the **existing `body.menu`** signal
(menu = `body.touch.menu`, in-game = `body.touch:not(.menu)`) rather than inventing a `body.paused`-based
gate: paused is a subset of in-game and the real failure mode (chrome returns on background/restore) hits
active play too, so a paused-only fix (the original narrower request) was rejected. The `⛶` keeps its
bottom-right menu placement and moves **left of the rocket, raised above the bottom chrome** in-game
(`right:124; bottom:58`), with an explicit ~12px horizontal gap from the rocket hit area so it never sits
under the thumb's fire/boost path. On iPhone (no Fullscreen API, so "not fullscreen" ≈ "not standalone")
the a2hs pill now shows in-game too (`body.touch.no-fs-api:not(.standalone)`), tucked under the top-left
gear; it stays **non-interactive** (`pointer-events:none`).

**Trade-off.** This puts a control (and, on iPhone, a persistent pill) over live combat — extra HUD
clutter we'd normally avoid. Accepted because the harm from a stray tap is low (the button only re-enters
fullscreen, a no-op if already fullscreen) and the explicit rocket gap keeps it off the thumb path, while
the upside — recovering full screen without leaving the fight — directly addresses the failure mode.

**Stale-`body.fs` fix.** `body.fs` now re-syncs whenever the page returns to the foreground —
`visibilitychange` (only when `!document.hidden`), plus `pageshow` and window `focus` as
belt-and-suspenders — in `welcome.js`, independent of the existing `fullscreenchange` listener and of the
`autoPauseOnBlur` logic in `sim.js`. We deliberately **do not** try to force fullscreen programmatically on
restore (browsers block it without a user gesture); the fix is to make the button reappear so the player
taps it.

## 45. Ship hitbox via convex decomposition → one OBB per part (vs multi-sphere / hand-authored / a physics engine)

Every ship used to collide as **one fat sphere** (`2.6 × scale` for enemies, a hardcoded `2.6` for the
player, and the player↔rocket test ignored size entirely). On elongated hulls that both over-covers the
sides (visual misses still hit) and under-covers the nose/tail (`2.6 < 3.06`, the model's real half-length),
so tip shots miss. We replaced it with a **per-part oriented-bounding-box (OBB) hitbox** auto-fit to each
hull by convex decomposition.

**Inscribed/packed spheres were the first cut, and were superseded.** The initial iteration on this branch
fit a chain of axis-slice spheres (`docs/plans/multi-sphere-hitbox-fit-research.md`). Spheres cannot wrap a
thin swept wing — a per-cross-section sphere is "a ball with bulges" that either over-covers the empty gap
between wings or under-covers the wingtips. So we moved to convex decomposition + one box per part.

**Fit = V-HACD convex decomposition, one PCA-OBB per part.** The fitter (`scripts/assets-hitboxes.mjs`)
decomposes the normalized hull into near-convex parts with **V-HACD** (`vhacd-js`) — each wing (incl. its tip
pod) becomes its own part — then wraps each hull's vertex cloud in a tight **PCA oriented box**: centroid +
symmetric covariance → eigenvectors (a small deterministic Jacobi solver) = box axes, project verts per axis
for the half-extents. Stored per box as `{c,h,u0,u1,u2}` (center, half-extents, three orthonormal group-local
axes). Chosen over inscribed/packed spheres (can't wrap a wing), hand-authored boxes, and a physics engine
because the game is a top-down arcade shooter where "does this point touch the hull" is the only query
(DECISIONS §30 — keep it simple): a handful of cheap OBB projection tests behind the broad sphere, no runtime
BVH/physics.

**`vhacd-js` is build-time only, and memory-safe.** A prior local spike OOM-froze the maintainer's Mac —
that was an unbounded dense distance-transform path, **not** V-HACD. V-HACD's `voxelResolution` is a bounded
voxel *count* (a few MB), so the fitter runs it at the library default **`voxelResolution: 400000`** — needed
to voxelize thin wings/noses that a coarser 100k grid skipped entirely. `maxVerticesPerHull: 32` and
`fillMode: 'raycast'` (the combat glbs are non-watertight — raycast interior test, no repair needed). Do not
go to an unbounded voxel/distance path. `vhacd-js` has no `main`/`exports`, only `"module"`, so it is
imported by the subpath `vhacd-js/lib/vhacd.js`; it never ships to the browser (the fitter runs in Node).

**Budget: `maxHulls` 48 + `minVolumePercentError` 0.5, to cover the wings (the "wing is transparent" fix).**
`maxHulls` is only a **part-count cap** — it does not grow the voxel grid, so raising it costs nothing
(empirically ~2 s/ship at 16 vs 64 hulls). At 16 hulls / error 1, V-HACD spent its budget unevenly and
**merged one wing into a body hull** whose tight OBB stopped at x≈±1.5 while the wing reached ±1.7 → the
player's outer +X wing was **~16% covered** (the rest of the ship ~99%), so shots passed straight through
it. Raising to **48 hulls + `minVolumePercentError: 0.5`** (refine each hull to within 0.5% volume) gives the
wing panels/tips their own hulls → **100% surface coverage** on every ship; 64/0.3 over-splits into slivers
whose OBBs leave gaps (the boss nose regressed to ~96%). A `node --test` surface-coverage guard (below) is
the gate that catches an under-covered fit — the size/union-span sanity all *passed* while the wing was 16%
open, because a hole doesn't change the overall bounds.

**Tight fit, with a min-thickness floor, and deterministic.** OBBs are meant to be tight — the whole point is
that a bullet through the empty gap **beyond a thin wing** misses — so the fitter adds only a tiny additive
`HITBOX_MARGIN = 0.05` (group-local, ~1.5% of length) to each half-extent, not the old multiplicative `1.1`
bubble. But a razor-thin part (a swept wing / a pointed nose fits an `h ≈ 0.02-0.06` slab) is **transparent**
to a discrete moving bullet: bullets step ~1 world unit/frame (speed 48-65 × dt, world scale 1.8×sizeScale),
so they tunnel through a slab thinner than a step between frames. So each box's per-axis half-extent is
**floored at `MIN_HALF = 0.1`** (group-local) — this only bumps the thin axis of a thin box (the boss's
chunky boxes, min ~0.09, are barely touched), turning a thin wing/nose into a hittable slab. A little slop on
a wing edge is the maintainer's arcade tolerance; transparent is not. PCA eigenvector order/sign is otherwise
arbitrary, so each OBB is **canonicalized** (axes sorted by descending half-extent, each flipped so its
largest-magnitude component is ≥ 0); with fixed V-HACD options + fixed rounding this makes running the script
twice byte-identical (asserted by the unit test). `broadR` is the exact farthest OBB corner from the origin
(~1.9-2.2, near the model half-length). Two `node --test` guards (`scripts/assets-hitboxes.test.mjs`): a
**size-sanity** test asserts every modeled ship's `broadR ≤ ~2.4`, each half-extent ≤ half-length, **every
box's min half-extent ≥ `MIN_HALF`** (so a transparent thin fit fails), and the **union full span** along
its longest axis sits `3.0 ≤ span ≤ 4.3` (≈ `SHIP_MODEL_LEN` 3.4, headroom for rotated-OBB overhang + the
clamp); and a **surface-coverage** test that decodes each ship's real combat glb, puts its vertices into the
exact runtime frame (the fitter's `gatherMesh`+`normalize`, mirroring `ship-factory.js`), and asserts **≥97%
of surface points overall + ≥90% per extremity (wingtips / nose / tail) are inside the fitted boxes** — the
gate that catches an under-covered fit (the wing hole was invisible to every bounds-based test). It requires
the combat glbs locally (`npm run assets:pull`) and skips cleanly without them (gitignored — same
precondition as the fitter). This also validates **placement**: if the fitter's frame ever drifts from
ship-factory's, coverage collapses and the test fails.

**Runtime point-vs-OBB test.** At runtime (`client/src/collision.js`) collision is **broad-phase** (one
enclosing `broadR × mesh.scale.x` sphere at `mesh.position`) → **narrow-phase** (point-vs-OBB): each box
center is transformed by `mesh.matrixWorld` (affine), each axis `uᵢ` is rotated by the matrix's upper-3×3 and
**renormalized** (world scale is uniform `sc = mesh.scale.x`), and the point is inside iff
`|dot(p − c, uᵢ)| ≤ hᵢ·sc + pad` for **all three** axes. `pad` (the rocket proximity fuse / blast reach)
expands every half-extent — a square-cornered Minkowski inflate, exact enough for a fuse. Transforming by
`matrixWorld` folds in position + heading + the 1.8× world scale but **not** the child `bankGroup` roll, so
collisions correctly ignore the cosmetic bank. `collision.js` is intentionally **THREE-free** (inline
matrix/vector math) so it's importable under `node --test`.

**Bullets are SWEPT (segment-vs-OBB), or they tunnel (the "bullets pass through thin wings" fix).** The
narrow-phase point test only samples the projectile's *end-of-frame* position (`sim.js`). A bullet steps
~1-3 world units/frame (`projectileSpeed` 48-65 × `dt` up to 0.05, × the 1.8×sizeScale world scale), which is
larger than a thin box's half-extent **along the travel axis** — so a wingtip/nose box (~0.1-0.2 world thick
in Z) sits entirely *between* two consecutive sample points and both land outside it → the bullet is
transparent to it. This is orthogonal to `MIN_HALF` (which is the *perpendicular* thickness) and to
resolution (the boxes are present — verified), so neither fixed it. The fix is `segmentHitsShip(ship, p0, p1,
pad)`: the bullet's movement segment (pre-move `p0` → post-move `p1`) vs each OBB — both endpoints are
transformed into the box's local frame (the same renormalized-axes/scale math), then a **slab test** clips
the segment against `±(hᵢ·sc + pad)` per axis; a segment-vs-enclosing-sphere broad phase gates the box loop.
It reduces to `pointHitsShip` when `p0==p1` (a strict superset). `sim.js` captures `p0` before
`b.mesh.position.addScaledVector(b.vel, dt)` and passes `p1 =` the moved position, for both bullet→enemy and
bullet→player. Rockets keep the point test — they're slow, homing (steer toward center) and carry a 0.5
`detonateR` pad (a large capture region), so they don't tunnel. Broad-phase gates the swept loop, so only
bullets already near a ship pay for it (mobile-safe). Why not just a bigger box / smaller bullet step: a
uniform inflate slops up the tight fit (re-opening BUG A's over-cover), and a fixed sub-step multiplies the
per-bullet cost; the analytic segment test is exact and cheap.

**Rocket blast damage is hull-relative too (the "rockets deal no damage" fix).** A rocket's detonation is
*triggered* hull-relative (`pointHitsShip(ship, pos, detonateR)`), so the detonation point lands on a
hull box — off the ship's center. The blast *damage* loop in `projectiles.js:detonateRocket`
originally still used `distanceTo(center) ≤ blastR`, so with the offset detonation point (and any offset
hitbox) it matched **nobody**: the rocket exploded visually but dealt zero damage, for both player and enemy
rockets. Fixed by making the damage loop hull-relative as well — `pointHitsShip(ship, pos, blastR)`. Since
`blastR ≥ detonateR`, a rocket that reaches a hull to detonate always deals its damage. A regression test
(`client/src/collision.test.js`) covers player→enemy and enemy→player, including a detonation point beyond
`blastR` of the center that the old test would have missed. **`detonateRadius` was also retuned down**
(rockets id 3/4/8: ~3.2–3.5 → **0.5**): since the trigger is now a `pad` measured from the *hull surface*
(not the center as before), the old large values made rockets detonate a full ship-length away. `0.5` is
near contact with the hull boxes while staying ≥ ~one frame of rocket travel (rockets accelerate to ~56 u/s,
~0.9 world unit/frame at 60fps) so a fast rocket can't tunnel past the ship without detonating — and the
broad-phase region (~4 world units) spans many samples as the rocket crosses it, so contact is reliable.

**Frame.** Boxes live in the **group-local noseZ frame** (after ship-factory's auto-scale to
`SHIP_MODEL_LEN` 3.4 + recenter + `yaw`), same frame as `userData.noseZ`. The fitter replicates that exact
normalization (including the merged triangle indices V-HACD needs) on the glb verts before decomposing, so
the boxes drop straight into the runtime frame.

**Config lands in the seed by auto-rewrite, not by hand.** `assets:hitboxes` writes the boxes into each
ship's `model:{}` block in `catalog_seed.js` via a **marker-delimited, idempotent** surgical edit
(`/* hitboxes:auto:start */ … /* hitboxes:auto:end */`); the same edit also **consumes any legacy
`/* hitspheres:auto:* */` span**, so one run migrates the seed off the old data. It preserves comments/key
order, then verifies by re-importing the seed and deep-comparing. Hand-authoring was rejected — the fit is
bounds math no human should transcribe, and a marked span keeps re-runs deterministic (running twice yields
an identical file).

**No meshopt decoder shipped.** The combat glbs are meshopt-compressed and reading them via `NodeIO`
needs a decoder we don't depend on. Rather than add `meshoptimizer`, the fitter decodes each glb to a plain
temp glb with the `@gltf-transform/cli` via `npx` (the same "no hard dep" pattern as `assets:build`), then
reads that. We fit the **combat** glb (what actually renders in battle), not the high-poly source/hangar.

**Fallback.** Primitive/un-modeled ships (no `hitBoxes`) keep the legacy single `2.6 × sizeScale` broad
sphere — unchanged behavior. `e.radius` is retained purely as the over-enemy health-bar / marker anchor.
## 46. Triple spiral rocket = 1 invisible homing leader + 3 real child rockets (not a single leader-detonation)

The triple spiral rocket (weapon id 11) is modeled as **four `rockets`-pool entries per fire**: an
**invisible leader** that carries all the homing (steer + accelerate toward the target, no damage, not
shootable) and **three visible warheads** that ride it, each a full rocket with its own `power`, `health`,
proximity `detonateRadius` (0.5, hull-relative — see §45), and blast.

- **Alternative considered:** one homing rocket that, on detonation, deals 3× damage (or spawns three
  cosmetic sub-rockets). Rejected — the headline feature is that **each warhead is real**: it deals its own
  damage, can be **individually shot down** by gunfire, and connects independently (1–3 hits land depending
  on how many survive). A single-detonation model can't express "shoot one down, the other two still hit."
- **Why the split (leader vs. warheads):** it keeps the **homing logic in exactly one place** (the leader
  reuses the existing rocket steering block verbatim) while the three warheads reuse the **existing
  rocket-vs-bullet interception and `detonateRocket` code paths untouched** — they already have `hp`,
  `obj.position`, `fromPlayer`, and blast fields, so no new pool, no per-warhead guidance, no bespoke
  collision code (§30 simplicity). The warheads' positions are derived each frame from the leader
  (`spiralOffset` corkscrew), so they don't steer themselves.
- **Lifecycle bookkeeping:** the leader counts live `children`; every warhead-removal path (proximity
  detonation, bullet shoot-down, out-of-range) funnels through one `removeRocket` helper that decrements it,
  and the leader self-removes when the count hits 0 or it reaches `maxRange`. The leader is never passed to
  `detonateRocket` (no mesh child / blast fields) — it's skipped in the interception + detonation loops and
  cleaned up in its own branch.

## 47. Off-plane hulls: per-model `lift` workaround, not a global collision fix (yet)

The game is top-down and bullets fly in the world **y≈0.6 plane** (the ship group's origin, group-local
y=0). Models are auto-centered on their bounding box, so a ship whose visual mass sits **below** its bbox
centre (tall turrets pulling the centre up, a drooped nose) leaves the hull below the bullet plane —
centre-aimed shots pass *over* it. Reported concretely on **enemy_3** (shots flew over the nose). §45's
tight OBB fit is faithful to the model, so it faithfully reproduces this miss.

**Decision:** a per-model **`model.lift`** (group-local +Y, pre-scale) that raises the **visual model and
its hitboxes together** into the bullet plane, rather than a global collision change.

- **Alternatives (deferred to ROADMAP):** (a) flatten every hitbox onto the y=0 plane / give bullets a tall
  vertical capsule — changes collision feel for *all* ships and hides genuine vertical structure; (b) fix it
  at export time by re-centering each glb — re-runs the whole asset pipeline per model and isn't trusted
  (§ model transforms are runtime-normalized, not baked). Both are heavier than the problem, which today is
  a handful of models.
- **Why lift is safe:** it's a single value that drives **both** `pivot.position.y` (visual) **and** every
  hitbox `c.y` (plus `broadR += |lift|`), so the model and its collision boxes can never desync — the class
  of bug that a "shift the hitboxes only" fix would invite. Default `0` leaves every other ship untouched.
- **Why not just accept the limitation:** it's a per-model *tuning* knob, not a mechanic — cheap to set
  (`enemy_3: 0.2`, player `0.18`), verified per model, and reversible. The general fix stays scheduled; this
  removes the visible sting on the ships that have it now (§30 keep-it-simple).

**The bullet plane is a formalized invariant, not a scattered `0.6`.** The move-the-model (never the
bullets) rule only holds if there's exactly one bullet plane. So `client/src/state.js` exports
**`BULLET_PLANE_Y = 0.6`** as the single source of truth: every ship group sits at this world Y, and since
muzzle/exhaust spawn from `mesh.position` + a **planar** (y=0) forward/right vector, ALL bullets — player
and enemy, every model — fly in exactly this plane. Ship spawn/recenter Y (`ship-factory`, `ship-build`,
`sim`) and the flat hit-ring FX (`projectiles`) reference the constant, never a bare literal. (We kept the
plane at 0.6 rather than shifting to literal world 0 — 0.6 is already model-independent, and re-zeroing
would be cosmetic churn across exhaust/HP-bar/ring code with shadow/ground regressions for no gameplay
gain.) `lift` is then simply "the signed offset that anchors a model's hull onto this invariant plane."

**`lift` is signed, and the fitter warns when a model needs one.** A hull can sit *above* the plane
(bbox centre below the deck) as easily as below, so `lift` is a signed group-local Y offset (positive
raises, negative lowers). To stop a freshly-fit model from silently shipping see-through from above, the
`assets:hitboxes` generator prints a **bullet-plane coverage** report — how many hitboxes the plane crosses
at the current `lift`, and the lift that maximises it — and flags any ship that could seat ≥2 more boxes.
Coverage is `|c.y + lift| ≤ Σ|uᵢ.y|·hᵢ`, which is exact and **invariant to heading and scale** (rotation
about Y preserves each axis's Y component; uniform scale cancels through the origin). `bestLift` scans a
**fine grid** and returns the **centre of the peak plateau**, not the plane-crossing extremum: a lift
exactly on a box edge grazes that box on a razor line (not a real hit), so the plateau centre — where the
plane passes *through* the seated boxes with margin on both sides — is the robust suggestion. It's a
*warning, not a build failure*: over-shifting to grab one more box can float/sink the model, so the
maintainer sets `lift` deliberately (see the `update-ship-model` skill). All 9 modeled ships are tuned to
their robust max (player `0.18`; enemy_1 `0.21`, enemy_2 `0.17`, enemy_3 `0.2`, enemy_4 `-0.132` — the boss
hull sat above the plane, so it's the one *lowered*).

## 48. In-game credits screen: legal obligation + parse-at-build committed module (vs runtime fetch)

Every 3D model we ship is **CC-BY 4.0**, whose license text *requires* attribution be shown to the people
who receive the work — i.e. **players**, not just a repo doc. Keeping the credits only in
`client/assets/CREDITS.md` (which players never see) left us formally out of compliance, so we added a
player-facing **Credits & attributions** screen (opened from the Settings gear — the one chrome surface
reachable on menus *and* in-game, and both distribution surfaces need it: vega.tenony.com and itch.io).

**Data path = parse-at-build into a committed module, NOT a runtime fetch.** The client is buildless
(§31 — raw ES modules; the vega/local serve has no build step, and `build-itch.mjs` only *copies*
`client/`). A runtime `fetch('CREDITS.md')` would need the raw md served same-origin on **both** builds and
still require filtering the repo-internal prose out of a compliance UI. Instead `npm run credits:build`
(`scripts/credits-build.mjs`) parses `CREDITS.md` → a **committed** `client/src/credits-data.js` the client
imports; both builds consume the committed module (and `build:itch` regenerates it into the staged tree as
a belt-and-suspenders guard). A `--check` mode wired into `client/src/credits-data.test.js` fails CI if the
committed module drifts from `CREDITS.md` — the same deploy-guard shape as `assets:check`.

**Two STRUCTURED parts of `CREDITS.md` are parsed; the narrative prose is ignored.** (1) the 5-column asset
table gives the asset SET + each row's author, source URL, license and group (`ships/` → models,
`sounds/` → sounds); (2) the **verbatim CC-BY blockquote attribution lines** (`> "TITLE" (URL) by AUTHOR
…`) give the TASL-correct **work title**, matched to its table row by Source URL. The Asset cell is a
repo file path, so slicing it yields a broken label (`sounds/kinetic..mp3`, a dangling `.glb`) — a
non-compliant credit — hence CC-BY rows take the blockquote title, courtesy rows take the parenthetical
description, and a cleaned-filename fallback guarantees a label is never a raw path. **A CC-BY row with no
matching verbatim block is a hard error** (throws): the verbatim block is itself required for compliance, so
a missing one is a real bug, never a silent path fallback. An unknown license string also throws (a new
license type must be handled deliberately).

**Chrome i18n, attribution content literal.** Panel title, section headings, "Modified", "Source", "Close",
"by {author}" are i18n keys (`ui.credits.*`, EN+RU); author names, work titles, license names and URLs come
straight from the generated data and are never translated (they are literal/legal text). Scope is a plain
scrollable list — no thumbnails/search/pagination (§30).

## 49. L1/L2 reward is server-installed (unchanged); the battlefield drop is COSMETIC to guarantee exactly one copy

The L1 Machine Gun / L2 repair drone reveal now happens as a glowing drop on the battlefield when the level's
last enemy dies, but the **one guaranteed copy is still delivered solely by the existing, idempotent server
force-install on victory** (clearing L1 runs L2's briefing `replaceWeapon 1→5`; clearing L2 runs L3's
`installComponent repair 12`). The battlefield drop **deposits nothing** to the stash.

**Why cosmetic-only.** If the drop *also* deposited into the stash, any player who grabbed it would end up with
**two** Machine Guns / repair drones (one from the grab, one from the server install). Leaving the guaranteed
copy exclusively with the idempotent server path keeps "grab it or not — doesn't matter" literally true and is
**dupe-proof on replays** (the install is a no-op when the item is already mounted/installed). The single
load-bearing line is `collect()` gating the `pendingLoot` push on `shouldDeposit(d)` = `!d.special`.

**Why not refactor the reward path** (a `reward.actions` block, a `/claim-reward` endpoint, moving the grants
off the briefings): the existing briefing actions already deliver exactly one copy at the right time and are
idempotent, so the smallest correct change (DECISIONS §30) is a **client-side cosmetic drop** plus an
ownership gate (`ownsReward` — don't spawn the drop if the reward is already owned, so replays show at most a
normal loot box). The showcase + grant actions on the L2/L3 briefings are untouched; only their **text** was
reworded to a "you recovered it" framing to match the new reveal.

---

## 50. Item rarity is DERIVED from price/buyable, not hand-authored per row (one explicit override)

The new `rarity`/`color` on `components`/`weapons` are stamped by a single classifier in `catalog_seed.js`
(`rarity = explicit override ?? ((price>0 && stats.buyable !== false) ? 'common' : 'trash')`), not written
out per row. The **only** hand-set value is `rarity: 'rare'` on the Triple spiral rocket. Colors are a fixed
map (trash `#ffffff`, common `#59e0a0`, rare `#0000ff`).

**Why derived.** The intended semantics *already exist* in the data: shop-available items (priced +
buyable) should read common; every pirate/enemy part (`buyable:false`) and price-0 boss part should read
trash. Deriving from those fields makes rarity **self-consistent by construction** — a new catalog row gets
the right tier for free, and there's no risk of a hand-typed rarity drifting out of sync with a row's
price/`buyable` flags. The escape hatch (a per-row `rarity`) covers the one case the rule can't infer (a
priced, buyable, but "special" weapon), keeping the smallest surface area (DECISIONS §30).

**Trade-off / when to revisit.** If rarity ever needs to diverge from price/buyable for many rows (e.g. a
premium-but-cheap cosmetic, or a tiering that isn't price-monotonic), the derived rule stops paying off and
the honest move is to hand-author `rarity` per row (or add a dedicated design column) rather than pile on
overrides. Today, with one override, the rule is the simpler and safer choice.

## 51. Flat player top speed + engine buff + pause-safe opening-combat grace (supersedes §2's "no speed limit" for the player)

Four correlated pacing/feel changes to the opening of a run (`docs/plans/2026-07-05-2126-player-speed-cap-engine-buff.md`):

**Flat `PLAYER_MAX_SPEED = 30` for the player, per-engine `maxSpeed` for enemies.** The player was
previously *uncapped* (§2's "no speed limit"), so velocity grew unbounded with thrust and arena traversal
time was unpredictable. We cap the player at a single flat movement-system constant clamped in `sim.js`
(after thrust/autopilot converge, before position integration — so both control paths obey it). We did
**not** repurpose the player's engine `maxSpeed` for this: the Basic engine (id 5) carries `maxSpeed: 0`, so
there was no per-engine cap to reuse, and a flat constant keeps player handling **predictable independent of
engine choice**. Enemies are untouched — they still clamp to `e.engine.maxSpeed`. This **supersedes §2's
"no speed limit" clause for the player** (mirrored by the §2 amendment); §2's inertia/no-friction/drift model
otherwise stands. Cosmetic wrinkle (left as-is): the per-engine `maxSpeed` shop stat is now decorative for
the player — but it already was, since the player was uncapped before.

**+50% engine `power` (acceleration), `maxSpeed` untouched.** Every engine's `power` is buffed ×1.5 (Basic
10→15, Scout 12.6→19, Boss 19→29, Solid-fuel 14→21, Ion 18→27, Pirate 12.6→19, Second-boss 30→45) so ships
(player *and* engine-sharing enemies) reach top speed faster — snappier acceleration without raising the
ceiling. Thrusters (turn) and all `maxSpeed`/`exhaust`/`weight`/`price` values are unchanged.

**5 s enemy hold-fire grace, timed on accumulated sim `dt` (pause-safe) not wall-clock.** Enemies spawn,
move and aim from frame one but hold fire until `G.combatElapsed >= 5`. The clock advances by `dt` inside
`update(dt)`, which is skipped entirely while paused — so **pausing during the on-ramp does not burn the
breather** (a wall-clock `performance.now()` timer would). Deliberately **silent** (no HUD/countdown/banner,
DECISIONS §30). The player also **opens each run gliding forward at 3 u/s** (10% of top speed) instead of
dead-stopped; the drift is momentary by design (bleeds off via `IDLE_DRAG` if no control is held).

## 52. L1 welcome drops the ship picker (single-ship level) + pins Take off via grid

At Level 1 the player owns **exactly one ship** (extra hulls are bought in the Main Window shop at L2+), so
the welcome-screen ship picker (`.pick` label + `#ship-choices` cards) offered no real choice — it was
decorative. Removing it loses no functionality (take-off still needs a non-null `selectedShip`, now defaulted
directly to `playerShips[0]` in `showWelcome`) and, on its own, already relieved the *visible* symptom by
shrinking the content.

Separately, `#welcome` moved from a **centered-flex column** (`overflow-y:auto`, whose `justify-content:center`
+ overflow **clips the unreachable *top*** of the greeting/intro on short viewports — the classic
centering-in-a-scroll-container trap, where the overflowed top can't be scrolled into reach) to a
**`1fr/auto` CSS grid**: a scrollable greeting/intro cell over a **pinned footer** (Take off + community link).
The scroll cell keeps the "centered when it fits, top-aligned + scrolls when it overflows" behavior via the
flexbox auto-margin trick (`:first-child{margin-top:auto}` / `:last-child{margin-bottom:auto}`), which does
NOT clip the top.

**Why.** This makes the Take-off on-screen invariant **structural** — guaranteed by the layout, not a
content-dependent side effect of how tall the intro happens to render — mirroring the Main Window's
already-pinned Take off. It's a minimal robustness fix (a few lines of CSS remove a whole class of "the
button drifted off-screen" fragility), **not** §30 over-engineering. A committed regression guard (scenario
18 at 900×360) asserts both that the scroll region genuinely overflows and that the footer is flush to the
content bottom, so a revert to the flex column fails loudly.

## 53. Enemy spawns are staggered (2–4 s cooldown), first-of-phase immediate

The level runner previously refilled the arena to `maxConcurrent` **every frame**: a phase's opening wave
snapped to full instantly and a killed enemy was replaced on the very next frame. That felt cramped and
spawn-camped — the arena was always packed and refills were invisible.

**Decision.** Gate **every** enemy spawn behind a randomized **2–4 s** cooldown (`2 + Math.random()*2`) so
enemies trickle in one at a time and a phase populates 1→2→3… toward its `maxConcurrent`. The **first** enemy
of each phase is **immediate** (the cooldown resets to 0 on `enterPhase()`), so no phase ever shows an empty
arena at its start — and the boss/finale (which spawns alone after its clear-out phase empties the arena)
still appears the instant its phase begins, **with no special-case**. Each spawn arms a fresh 2–4 s delay.

**Post-kill replacements are staggered too.** The cooldown only counts down while a slot is actually open
(`alive < maxConcurrent` and budget remains); while the arena is **full the timer is frozen**, so the moment
a kill frees a slot the remaining 2–4 s must still elapse — a kill never triggers an instant refill. This is
deliberate (a future reader must not "fix" it back to a per-frame top-up); the unit test pins it down.

**Scope/shape.** Simplest form per §30: an inline `2 + rand()*2` in one tiny pure helper
(`client/src/spawn-timing.js` — `stepSpawnGate`/`nextSpawnDelay`), unit-tested by injecting a stub RNG. **No**
seeded-RNG system, **no** per-phase/per-level tuning of the window. The helper is a separate leaf (not inline
in `sim.js`) because `sim.js` imports `engine.js`, which builds a `WebGLRenderer` at import and can't load
headless — mirroring why `server/src/enemy_total.js` exists as a testable oracle. **No server/`enemyTotal`
change:** staggering changes *pacing*, not the total number of enemies that eventually spawn, so the
per-level totals and the `allCleared` advance condition are unaffected (clear-out phases just take a little
longer to fully spawn). The `win` / return-to-base flow is untouched.

---

## 54. Deterministic spawn totals (explicit per-phase `total`) + warp-in IS the stagger delay

§53's staggering **broke** the assumption §53 claimed to preserve. The precomputed `enemyTotal`
(`server/src/enemy_total.js`) modeled the *old* instant-fill runner: a `kills`/`killsSincePhase` threshold
phase snapped to `maxConcurrent` and so left exactly `maxConcurrent` enemies **alive** ("carry") when it
advanced, which a later `allCleared` clear-out phase then killed. Staggering trickles enemies in one at a
time, so a threshold phase now advances with **far fewer** than `maxConcurrent` alive — the actual kills to
clear a level came out variable (e.g. L1 14/15 instead of the precomputed 16). The HUD "destroyed X/Y"
counter stopped short and the single drop trigger `kills === enemyTotal` (§30) never fired, so the L1
Machine Gun and L2 Repair-drone reward drops silently vanished. A carry-based oracle can't survive a
non-deterministic fill rate.

**Decision.** Make counts **deterministic**: every spawning phase carries an explicit `spawn.total` cap. A
threshold phase's `total` equals its kill-delta (so it leaves **0** alive at advance — a larger cap leaves
survivors; a smaller cap deadlocks), and the "carry" remainder becomes a **real spawning clear-out/finale
wave** (drawn from that level's wave-2 pool; L1, which has no clear-out, folds it into its finale). So
`enemyTotal` is simply the **sum of every phase's `spawn.total`** — `enemy_total.js` collapses to that sum,
the counter reaches N/N, and the drop fires on the true last kill. Per-level totals are preserved except
**L1 intentionally drops 16→14** (two fewer finale rocketeers): L1=14, L2=17, L3=21, L4=22, side=20. **No
second/structural drop trigger** (§30) — the one deterministic condition stays, extracted into a pure
`isLastKillDrop({kills, enemyTotal})` and guarded by a new headless full-level replay
(`client/src/level-sim.js` + test) that proves the counter reaches `enemyTotal` and the drop fires on the
last kill. That missing coverage is what let the regression ship.

**Warp-in becomes the arrival animation.** Rather than an empty 2–4 s gap then a separate 1 s pop, a spawned
enemy appears **immediately** as a dot and **materializes over its stagger interval** — the armed 2–4 s
cooldown, carried per-instance on `e.spawnDur` (the global `SPAWN_GROW_TIME` 1 s stays as the default and
the player warp-back). While forming (`e.warping`) it is **invulnerable, cannot fire, and is not a valid
homing-rocket target**, so the staggered trickle can't be spawn-camped mid-materialize; it still counts
toward `maxConcurrent` (preserving §53's pacing) and shows its edge marker so the arrival reads. All three
player→enemy damage paths skip warping enemies (bullet collision + rocket detonation trigger in `sim.js`,
and the **separate** blast-splash loop in `projectiles.js`), so a warping enemy's hp stays `maxHp` and no
health bar ever shows on a dot. The shot-down rocket path (`detonateRocket(r,false)`) is unaffected. This
supersedes §53's "No server/`enemyTotal` change" claim.

## 55. Pipeline run history = committed JSONL journal, not an observability platform

The `/feature-pipeline` orchestrator now persists every run to `docs/pipeline-runs.jsonl` (one JSONL line
per run: per-agent tokens/tool-calls/time, loop counters, critic/reviewer findings, review-gate decision,
live-test outcome) to enable longitudinal analysis of agent effectiveness — chiefly the **escaped-defect
rate** (bugs the live test caught that critic *and* reviewer both passed), plus token cost trends.

**Decision.** Store it as a **committed, append-only JSONL file in `docs/`**, queried with `jq`/DuckDB —
not a hosted observability platform. Rationale: this is a single-author repo with a few pipeline runs at a
time; a git-diffable, human-readable journal is the simplest thing that answers "how good is the critic /
reviewer, and what did this cost" without standing up Langfuse/OTel + ClickHouse/Redis (§30). Rates are
**derived at query time**, not stored, so metric definitions can evolve without a migration.

**Alternatives considered.** *CSV* — rejected: records are nested (per-agent objects, findings arrays)
and the schema will grow; CSV forces flattening. *Committed SQLite* — deferred: JSONL suffices until SQL
with indexes is actually needed. *SaaS/self-hosted observability (Langfuse, Arize Phoenix, OTel collector
→ Grafana)* — rejected **for now** as over-engineering for one author, but kept as the documented **escape
hatch**: Claude Code emits OTel GenAI spans/metrics natively (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, per-subagent
tokens/cost, delegation chain as one trace), so the upgrade path is real if run volume or a dashboard need
ever justifies it. The **review gate** (Stage 4.5) shipped in the same change is the standard
human-in-the-loop interrupt, deliberately placed on the least-reversible step (implementation + deploy) per
"don't interrupt on reversible steps." Full spec: `docs/plans/pipeline-review-gate-and-run-log.md`.

## 56. Admin device label = hand-rolled UA parse + curated code→marketing-name lookup, no dependency

The `/admin` "device" column needs to turn a raw `User-Agent` + a `Sec-CH-UA-Model` device **code** into a
readable `Browser · Device/OS` label. We deliberately **skip** `ua-parser-js` / a full device database and
hand-roll it: a few robust regexes (`parseBrowser`/`parseOS`) plus a small curated `DEVICE_NAMES` map
(common Samsung/Xiaomi/Pixel/Apple codes → marketing names) with a **raw-code fallback** for anything
unknown. Rationale: the admin panel has a **no-new-deps precedent** and DECISIONS §30 (keep-it-simple,
single author) — a device DB is heavy, needs updating, and this is a maintainer-only eyeballing aid, not
analytics. The trade-off is accepted: unknown device codes show the raw code, and browser/OS detection is
approximate. The signal is **deliberately partial**: the model only arrives from **Chromium same-origin**
visits (opt-in via the `Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Model` header — modern Android's UA hides the model), so
Safari/Firefox and the cross-origin itch embed degrade to UA-only, and existing rows stay `NULL` until the
player next boots (no retroactive data, no backfill). We store the **raw** UA + model code and do all
parsing/formatting at **render time**, so the label (and the `DEVICE_NAMES` map) can improve later with **no
migration or backfill**. Capture is **latest-wins** (unlike write-once `referrer`, §36): device metadata
reflects the player's *current* device, and `resetPlayer` intentionally leaves it in place (it's not
progress).

## 57. Grab tractor = inverse-square field with emergent, weight-independent range

The Grab (tractor) used to pull any drop inside a hard radius (`range = strength`) at a constant,
distance-independent speed (`(strength/2)·(10/weight)`). We replaced it with an **inverse-square field**:
`field(strength, dist) = strength·FIELD_K/dist²` (`FIELD_K = 5`), and the beam **engages a drop only where
`field ≥ FIELD_CUTOFF`** (`0.4`). Pull speed is `field·(10/weight)` — it now **rises the closer a drop is**,
so near drops snap in and far ones crawl, which reads like a real tractor beam.

Two consequences are deliberate. (1) **Range is emergent, not a stored stat:** the reach is wherever the
field crosses the cutoff, `range(strength) = sqrt(strength·FIELD_K/FIELD_CUTOFF)`, so there is no separate
range number to store, tune, or keep in sync — one `strength` value drives both reach and speed. (2) **Range
is weight-independent:** the cutoff test uses `field`, which has **no weight term**; weight scales only the
speed. A heavy item is pulled from just as far as a light one, only slower — item weight can never change how
far the beam reaches.

We **kept the strength values at 10 (base) / 20 (Advanced)** rather than retuning them. Because range scales
with `sqrt(strength)`, the equal 2× ratio makes the Advanced grab reach exactly **√2× the base** (≈15.8 vs
≈11.2 u) — a modest, believable reach upgrade instead of doubling it, while still doubling the field strength
(and thus pull speed) at any given distance. No DB/schema change: `strength` lives in the catalog `stats`
JSON and is untouched.

The **shop keeps showing the raw `strength` number** (10/20), relabeled as an abstract "grab strength"
rather than claiming to equal the world-unit range (option a). Per §30 (keep-it-simple, single author) this
is one existing surface with minimal churn; showing the derived range would add a computed display for a
maintainer-facing tuning aid nobody asked for. Near-ship singularity (`field→∞` as `dist→0`) needs **no
clamp**: collection at `COLLECT_DIST = 3` fires before a drop nears `dist=0`, and the per-frame move is
capped at `Math.min(speed·dt, d)`, so an over-large near-field speed can never overshoot the ship.
Constants `FIELD_K = 5` and `FIELD_CUTOFF = 0.4` are fixed for this iteration (no player-facing tuning UI).

**Follow-up (2026-07-07): reel-in speed is a linear ramp, not the field.** Two rounds of live play refined the
*speed* (the reach was right from the start and never changed). First we decoupled speed from reach with a
scalar `PULL_SPEED_SCALE = 0.67` (since `FIELD_K` scaled both), slowing the pull ~1.5×. But the `1/dist²` speed
still spiked near the ship — drops crawled far out then snapped in, which read as a jerk. So we **replaced the
speed model entirely with a linear ramp by distance**: `pullSpeed(weight, dist)` rises linearly from
`PULL_SPEED_FAR = 1` u/s (far, and the floor at/beyond `PULL_FAR_DIST = 11`) to `PULL_SPEED_NEAR = 4` u/s at the
ship (both weight-10 refs), then `·(10/weight)`. A constant slope is deliberately un-physical but has **no
near-ship jerk** and plays better — the maintainer explicitly preferred playability over physical correctness
here. `PULL_SPEED_SCALE` was retired (folded into the near/far anchors). **Reach is untouched** — it still comes
only from `field`/`FIELD_CUTOFF` (the range tests did not move), so the emergent √2 advanced-vs-base ratio holds.
A consequence: **pull speed no longer depends on `strength`** (it dropped out of the `pullSpeed` signature) —
strength drives reach only; the speed profile is uniform across grabs. `PULL_SPEED_NEAR`/`PULL_SPEED_FAR`/
`PULL_FAR_DIST` are the speed knobs, `FIELD_K`/`FIELD_CUTOFF` the reach knobs.

## 58. Perf regression gate is a relative A/B (same job), not an absolute threshold

**Problem.** Weak phones (A03s/Redmi, DECISIONS §23) are the floor, but a code change that quietly adds ~2%
per-frame CPU cost is invisible in review and only surfaces as "the game feels heavier" much later. We want to
catch a **>2% CPU regression before it lands** — but 2% is far below the noise of any single wall-clock
number (vsync/compositor jitter, thermal drift, GC pauses swamp it), and it's device- and browser-specific, so
there is no meaningful *absolute* budget ("update must be < 0.5ms") to assert against.

**Decision.** Measure it as a **relative A/B**: replay a fixed input **trace** identically on the **merge-base
build (A)** and the **feature build (B)** on the **same machine, same headless Chromium, same job**, interleave
the reps (`A,B,A,B,…`, cancels slow thermal drift), and compare each JS-work bucket's **median across reps**
with a **bootstrap 95% CI on the ratio `(B/A−1)`**. Flag **REGRESSION** only when the CI *lower bound* exceeds
**+2%** — i.e. we are statistically confident the true delta is >2%, not point-estimate noise. Because both
builds run on one browser binary, transcendental last-bit FP differences never enter the comparison, and the
absolute machine speed cancels in the ratio. Determinism is bought by pinning the three nondeterminism sources
(seeded `Math.random`, a fixed `1/60` `dt`, a recorded per-tick input snapshot) — the game sim is already a
pure function of `(state, keys, touchAim, dt, random)` with **no wall-clock in the math**.

**Metric = `js.*`, never `fps`/`frameMs`.** Wall-clock frame time is vsync/compositor-noisy and never
2%-detectable (per `perf-low-end-phones.md`). The gate keys on the CPU/JS buckets `update`/`dom`/`render`/
`total` that `devPerf` already produces — the half that *can* be measured deterministically on a desktop. Two
resolution details the implementation forced (both from measuring on the swiftshader dev machine): (1) Chromium
clamps `performance.now()` to 100µs, so a per-tick **median** of quantized samples jumps in coarse steps — each
rep is aggregated by the **mean** (of ~780 ticks, which averages back to sub-quantum resolution), with the
**median taken *across* reps** for GC robustness. (2) On **software GL the `render` bucket rasterizes on the
CPU** and is genuinely ~10–20% noisy, dominating `full.js.total`; the tight 2%-sensitive signal is therefore
**`sim`-mode `js.update`** (a pure `update(dt)` loop, no render). The gate fires on **either** `sim.js.update`
**or** `full.js.total`, so a real CPU regression is caught by the clean `sim` signal even when `full` is too
noisy to resolve 2% (on real-GPU CI the `full` bucket tightens). This is why the CI is **paired** — `A[i]`/`B[i]`
run back-to-back (order flipped each round) so common-mode machine noise cancels in the ratio.

**Scope: CPU-only — the GPU blind spot is explicit.** A green gate is **not** "no A03s regression": a change
that only adds GPU cost (an extra additive-particle layer, a render pass, a bigger backbuffer, a heavier
shader) can regress a real phone while `js.*` stays flat, because browsers don't expose GPU execution time on
mobile. The perf-low-end work found those devices were largely **fill-rate/thermal/compositor-governed**, which
no desktop run reproduces. So the gate additionally tracks structural signals from the per-tick `load` snapshot
(`draws`/`tris`/`particles`) and flags growth — but states plainly it is a **proxy, not a GPU measurement**.
Real-device `?dev` telemetry (§23) remains the source of truth for the GPU/thermal half.

**Load-pinning for gameplay diffs.** A trace replays *inputs*, not the world; a diff that changes gameplay
(turn rate, damage, spawn timing) could yield a different entity population on B and contaminate the delta with
"different amount of work." The canonical trace is **load-pinned** (`setup.maintainEnemies`): the replayer
respawns to hold a fixed enemy count each tick, so the per-frame workload is structurally constant regardless
of who wins the fight. The runner also reports per-build `load.*` and annotates "load diverged — treat Δ as
approximate" when A and B drift apart.

**Standalone tool + documented pipeline prose, NOT a CI hard-fail (§30).** Ship the runnable
`node client/bench/run.mjs` + the `?bench` hooks, and **document** the PERF A/B stage in the feature pipeline
(`multi-agent-pipeline.md` + the skill prompt) as prose the pipeline Claude executes — no GitHub Actions job,
no orchestrator code. On a REGRESSION the pipeline **surfaces the per-bucket table to the maintainer as a
blocking question** (accept the intended cost / send back / abandon), the same posture as the reviewer
returning CHANGES. Rationale: the gate needs a merge-base build to compare against (materialized per-PR), it is
inherently advisory (a 2% CPU cost can be a deliberate trade), and a single author doesn't need CI machinery
to enforce it (§30). Because build A is always the merge-base, on the first branch *after* the harness lands
build A has no `window.__bench` → the runner prints `gate inactive` and exits 0; real A/B activates on the
next feature. Cross-references §23 (the `?dev` monitor this reuses) and `docs/plans/perf-low-end-phones.md`.

## 59. Ambient ghost battle = committed transform-replay of a REAL in-game recording, a FIXED-world-anchor landmark shown in every mission except the freighter escort, re-centered by the player's mean path (player flies freely)

**Problem.** We want a small, *watchable* far-off skirmish — a distant space battle you can see raging as you
fly a mission — cheap enough to ship, that never perturbs the real fight. (It began as decor for the "save the
transport" freighter escort, hence the freighter reposition + the default anchor at that mission's spot, but
pivoted: it now reads better as a **distant landmark in the OTHER missions** — showing it inside the freighter
escort would compete with the player's own fight, so that mission is exactly where it's hidden.)

**Transform-replay, not a second sim.** The game world is **module-level singletons** (`G`, `enemies`,
`bullets`, the projectile pools in `state.js`); a concurrent second `update()` to animate a live ghost fight
would corrupt the player's actual fight. So we play a **committed transform track** at runtime as a **dumb
lerped animation** (ship transforms lerp with shortest-arc yaw; bullets snap) — no live sim, no
collision/targeting/HUD/audio wired to the ghosts by construction. The track records **transforms, not
inputs** (unlike the §58 perf trace): inputs would require re-running the sim at playback (the thing we're
avoiding), and transforms are trivially interpolable and never diverge.

**Authored by a REAL in-game recording (the primary path).** The maintainer wanted to conduct + watch *their*
battle, so the canonical track is captured by a **`?dev` recorder** (`window.__backdrop.record()/stop()/
status()` in `main.js`) that observes a live-played fight — the player (slot 0) + every enemy that appears
(each joins as a new `birth` slot, up to 16 slots) + ≤24 bullets, at 20 fps via a **dt accumulator initialized
`acc:0`** (a large sentinel would pass every ~60 fps frame while
the track is stamped `fps:20` → playback 3× too long at ⅓ speed; the `acc -= 1/fps` remainder-preserving
decrement yields exactly 20 keyframes/s) — then re-centers/quantizes and downloads a `backdrop-battle.js`
module (an authoring tool, like the credits/itch generators; the output is committed by hand). **A hand-flown
recording is NOT re-generable byte-identically — the committed JSON is the artifact** (no byte-identical
expectation). A **synthetic headless generator** (`window.__bench.bakeBackdrop` + `client/bench/
gen-backdrop.mjs`, seeded/fixed-dt via the §58 harness) is kept **only as a bootstrap/fallback** so the
runtime + tests function before the real recording exists; its output *is* deterministic, but that's a
convenience, not a requirement.

**VISIBLE-distant — reversing the initial "faint ambiance" guardrail (the playtest fix).** The first build
over-dimmed the battle into invisibility (`opacity 0.35 × darken 0.45 × scale 0.5 × y −48` — the near-top-down
camera foreshortened the ships to nothing and only the additive death-explosion punched through). The design
goal is now **a watchable distant battle**: near-opaque (`opacity 0.9`), **full color (no darken)**, moderate
scale (`0.8`), on a **lower layer at `y ≈ −60`**. The "distant / not-mine" read comes from **horizontal
separation** (a landmark off across the arena you fly toward) plus the depth separation, NOT from dimming.
`y −60 < 0.6` keeps it a **separate, unshootable layer** below the combat plane, and ghost death rings are
relocated off the combat plane (`spawnShipExplosion` gained an optional `ringY` param; the truthiness-guarded
`opacity`/`darken` hook on `applyShipModel` leaves real ships byte-unaffected — ghosts now pass `opacity` only).
All five values are **live-tunable**: a `?dev` "Backdrop" panel (lil-gui, mirrors `?tune`) exposes
**Depth / Scale / Opacity / Anchor X / Anchor Z** sliders that drive a persisted `GHOST_TUNE` object
(`localStorage['ghostTune']`, key + clamp/load/save mirror `graphics.js`'s tier discipline; committed defaults
in `GHOST_TUNE_DEFAULTS`) applied live each frame — so placement is dialed in during a real playtest, then the
final numbers are baked back into the defaults. **Depth default −14 → −30 → −60**: the maintainer reported the
Depth slider "does nothing", diagnosed **live** (camera projection) as **camera geometry**, not a bug — under
the near-top-down camera (`CAM_OFFSET 0,110,26`, world +Y ~97% along the view axis) moving `group.position.y`
moves the battle almost entirely **into depth** (apparent size / layer separation: ~19 px on screen per 16 u Δy
vs ~97 px for an equal Δz). So **Depth controls the layer only; the new absolute Anchor X/Z sliders are the
across-screen placement control** (they move the group across the ground plane, clearly visible) — Depth was NOT
repurposed for screen motion. `GHOST_TUNE` is a **single module-scope object** that both the panel (lil-gui
mutates in place) and the runtime `entry.update` (reads `GHOST_TUNE.y/ax/az` each frame) share — identity
confirmed, so slider drags reach the runtime; `loadGhostTune()` is called exactly once.

**Births + deaths, not a frozen cast (the second playtest fix).** The first recorder froze the cast at
record-start (nearest N enemies) — so over a 60 s clip every ghost eventually died and the loop decayed to a
lone player ship (the game spawns enemies in waves). Fix: each ship slot carries a **`birth`** (keyframe it
first appears, default 0) alongside **`death`** (−1 or a keyframe); a slot renders only for
`birth ≤ frame < death`. The recorder starts **player-only** and assigns a NEW `birth` slot to every enemy as
it appears — **including later waves** — up to a **16-slot total cap** (`MAX_GHOST_SHIPS`), back-filling
pre-birth placeholder samples so every slot array stays length `frames`. Slots are never reused (§30). This is
what keeps a long recording populated. Because the track can now hold 16 slots but a weak phone must not draw
16 ships, the tier gate became a **CONCURRENT-visible ceiling** (`maxConcurrent`, not "first N slots"): the
runtime builds one mesh per slot but shows only the born-and-alive ones up to `maxConcurrent` (hidden meshes
don't draw, so the draw-call cost §23 is bounded by the ceiling, not 16). A death only fires the explosion if
that ghost was **on-screen the prior frame** (`wasVisible`), so a capped-out or never-shown slot never pops a
sourceless burst. *(Playtest watch-item: on the **Balance** tier — concurrent cap 4 — if >4 slots are alive
when a visible ghost dies, a waiting slot pops in to fill the vacancy; it's masked by the coincident death
explosion and does not occur on High/8. Confirm it doesn't read as a jarring spawn.)*

**Re-center by a SINGLE FIXED OFFSET = the player's mean path → the player flies FREELY (the final anchoring
model, reversing two rejected ones).** The shared pure helper `recenterAndQuantize` (used by BOTH authoring
paths — one source of truth) subtracts **one constant** `(mean(p0.x), mean(p0.z))` (the mean of slot-0's / the
player's positions over the whole track) from every ship AND every bullet. Because only a **constant** is
removed: the player's real free-flight motion is **preserved** (it visibly flies, which the maintainer
required), enemies move naturally, and there is **no per-frame membership dependence → no birth/death jumps**.
Two earlier anchors were rejected: (a) the **per-frame cast centroid** stepped at every birth/death (~15
membership events), jerking the whole formation "downward" (a +Z step reads as downward on the top-down
camera); (b) **per-keyframe slot-0 subtraction** removed the drift jump-free but **pinned the player at origin**
(it stopped flying) — the maintainer rejected that too. The fixed mean offset is the synthesis: bounded like a
re-center, but the player keeps its motion. The cloud centers on the player's mean *path* (not the cast
centroid), so an enemy-biased formation sits slightly off the anchor — that's what the Anchor X/Z sliders nudge.
The committed track's bounded guard drops the old `slot0 ≡ (0,0)` assertion and instead asserts slot 0 is **NOT
constant** (its coords vary, its mean ≈ 0 — guards against regressing to pinning) and a loose `< 600 u` runaway
bound over live frames; a stale (old slot-0-pinned) committed track fails the "not constant" check, forcing a
re-record.

**Fixed ABSOLUTE world anchor + gate flipped to non-freighter missions.** The group is placed at the absolute
world coordinate `(GHOST_TUNE.ax, y, az)` (default `(−100,−450)`, the freighter mission's start) — the **same
world spot regardless of mission**, NOT `arenaCenter`-relative and NOT following any object; it's a **distant
landmark the freely-flying player heads toward**, fading in through the scene fog. It shows in **every mission
EXCEPT the freighter escort** (`G.activeMission?.title !== 'freighter'`: campaign `null` → shows, mining/
research → show, freighter → hidden because you're IN that fight). The build trigger MOVED off the freighter
set-piece into **`sim.js reset()`** (after the set-piece rebuild loop): a dynamic `import('./ghost-battle.js')`
(keeps it off the initial bundle + avoids a `sim.js↔world.js↔ghost-battle.js` static cycle) calls
`buildGhostBattle()` (no argument), which adds its group to `scene` AND pushes a `setPieces` entry so the
universal teardown at the next `reset()` removes it (no double-build). It **self-skips under both `?debug` AND
`?bench`** (`headless = search.includes('debug') || search.includes('bench')`) — the gate flip means the
feature now fires in the campaign, which the §58 perf trace exercises (`activeMission` null), and the async glb
loads would add nondeterministic draw/tri counts to `load.*`; skipping keeps the gate FLAT/deterministic. Its
real per-frame cost (≤8 extra ship draws + ≤24 bullet dots on High, less on Balance, 0 on Performance, and
**zero `update` cost** — it never touches `G`/`enemies`/projectiles) is a draw/fill matter judged on-device
(§58 GPU blind spot), deliberately not benched.

**Freighter reposition (render only).** The freighter render position moved **+50 z (−450 → −400)** while its
**mission `center` stays at −450**. The freighter is non-collidable decor with zero mechanical role
(enemy/player spawns + soft boundary key off `arenaCenter` = the mission center, not the freighter). Moving
both would shift the whole mission by a constant the player can't perceive; moving **only** the freighter is
what actually changes what the player sees (it now sits ahead of the forward-gliding spawn) and is
balance-neutral. 50 u is small vs the 70–130 u enemy spawn ring, so the freighter stays inside the fight.
(The ghost battle's default anchor `(−100,−450)` is the freighter mission's spot, but the ghost battle no
longer *shows* in that mission — it's the campaign/other-mission landmark; the two just share a default coord.)

**Record length 60 s** (~150–250 KB @ 20 fps / ≤16 slots / ≤24 bullets) — a longer, more watchable loop, still
within the KB budget.

**Tier / `?debug` / `?bench` gating** (the pure `ghostBattlePlan(tierName, headless)`): Performance = off
entirely (mirrors `nebulaBake:null`, §23); the **runtime** is skipped under `?debug` (headless visual suite,
mirroring the nebula bake §43) AND under `?bench` (the perf gate now runs the campaign where this fires — skip
so async glb loads don't flake `load.*`); `maxConcurrent` = **High/unknown 8 + bullets, Balance 4 / no bullets,
Performance 0**. The `?dev` recorder + panel are a separate flag and observe the live fight directly (no
conflict with the `?debug`/`?bench`-off runtime). **No new assets** (ghost ships reuse `player_combat` +
`enemy_*_combat`), so no CREDITS change and no itch-glb-404 risk (§37). Cross-references §38 (freighter
set-piece), §43/§23 (gating), §58 (the bench harness the bootstrap reuses + the gate this self-skips).

## 61. Intro "Level 0" via content-shift on stable seed names + one-shot `current_progress` +1, not a `sort_order` column or a full renumber

Level order is `levels.id` (insertion order) with name-keyed upserts, so a new *first* level needs the
lowest id. Rather than add a `sort_order` column (over-engineering, §30) or renumber every campaign title,
we keep the seed names `level-1`..`level-4` (stable ids 1-4), shift their descriptor CONTENT down one, and
append `level-5`. The campaign keeps its "Level 1"-"Level 4" labels/rewards/briefings intact (content
travels with the descriptor); only new players see the "Level 0" intro. Existing players are bumped `+1`
once (SQLite migration `022_intro_level0_shift.js`; a guarded `migrations_pg` one-shot on Postgres, run
after the levels seed so the FK on `current_progress` validates) so nobody is shoved onto different content.
The guard is load-bearing: Postgres has no versioned migrations, so a bare `+1` on every boot would keep
incrementing each deploy — the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING RETURNING name` sentinel makes it
run exactly once. Trade-off: the intro is labeled "Level 0" (a prologue) rather than a renumbered "Level 1",
accepted to avoid relabeling the whole campaign and touching every title/textKey. The intro also
**auto-launches** on first load (no welcome screen / Take-off, gated to `level.name === 'level-1'`) so a
brand-new player is dropped straight into the gentle fight; this skips the welcome take-off flow (default
ship only, no picker — which the welcome screen no longer offers anyway).

**§-number collision hazard (parallel-merge doc-conflict pattern):** on `main` the next free number was §60,
but the **parked** branch `feature/2026-07-08-2007-level-0-intro-cutscene` already claims `## 60.` (the
intro-cutscene decision). To avoid a collision when that branch later merges, this entry uses **§61**. If
§61 is somehow taken by merge time, renumber to the next free slot; whoever merges second reconciles. Do not
reuse §60.

## 62. Combat replay = deterministic INPUT-replay (record input + seed, re-run the real sim), NOT a transform "movie of positions"

We need to replay real fights — first for the Level-0 intro cutscene, later for alt-angle views and video
capture. The pre-existing ambient ghost-battle (§59) bakes per-frame **transforms** and dumb-replays them on
ghost meshes. That was fine for a distant backdrop but is structurally wrong for a hero close-up: bullets are
an anonymous position stream (can't be colored by owner → enemy bullets came out blue), there are no real
collisions, and 20 fps samples teleport (jerky). So combat replay uses **deterministic input-replay**:
record the player's per-tick input + the mulberry32 seed; replay by re-running the actual `sim`. Everything
is then native and free — real projectile colors, smooth physics, real FX, real collisions ("you see your
fire shoot down the rocket because it *is* the game"). The whole recording is `{seed, dt, shipId, level,
ticks:[{k,t}]}` — the determinism audit found the sim needs only the seed (spawn timing/positions/loot/reload
jitter all draw the global `Math.random`; no wall-clock or Map/Set-iteration-order deps in the sim path).
Reuses the `?bench` foundation (`installSeededRandom`/`mulberry32`/`BENCH_DT`). This mechanism is intended to
**supersede** the transform-replay for the foreground (§59's backdrop can migrate onto it later).

Two load-bearing sub-decisions surfaced in live testing:
- **Fixed-timestep accumulator, not one-step-per-frame.** Advancing one `BENCH_DT` step per rAF frame ran 2×
  on a 120 Hz screen. Both record and playback accumulate real elapsed time and take whole `BENCH_DT` steps,
  so pacing is real-time on any refresh rate while each tick stays a fixed dt. Frames ≠ ticks by design.
- **The seeded RNG must feed the sim ONLY.** Because frames ≠ ticks, any cosmetic per-frame `Math.random`
  (stars/FX/HUD/idle frames — and audio, which only runs when the ctx is unlocked) would consume the seeded
  stream by a count that differs between record and playback → divergence. Fix: keep a private seeded PRNG
  and swap it into `Math.random` **only around `update()`/`reset()`**, restoring a native (cosmetic) RNG for
  everything else; `audio.js` randomness moved to its own module-local PRNG. This is a stricter contract than
  §58's `?bench` (which runs headless with no cosmetic frames between ticks, so a bare global override
  sufficed there). Verified bit-for-bit (rounded-position state hash) across frame rate / audio / model-load
  timing. Also: record/playback wait for the ship `.glb` before the first tick (a **Start recording** button;
  playback holds the idle frame) so a run never opens on the blue placeholder.

**Storage:** recordings are treated as an **S3 asset** (like ship `.glb`s — off git, synced prod↔local via
`assets:pull`, referenced from seed when promoted to prod), chosen over committing traces to git or a DB
table. The current build uses `localStorage` (`replay:{id}`/`replay:last`) + a `{id}.json` download as the
same-browser dev loop, and the canonical intro trace ships as a content-hashed S3 asset (`recordings/`
prefix in `assets-config`/`assets-pull`, referenced from the `level-1` descriptor's `introTrace`, bundled
into the itch build). See `docs/plans/2026-07-09-replay-record.md`
and the `/record-playback` skill. **Testing caveat (bit us once):** the `localStorage` store is per-browser,
and Claude's `claude-in-chrome` automation drives the maintainer's REAL Chrome — so automated test recordings
write to the same `replay:last`/`replay:{id}` and can clobber the maintainer's own recording (they'd then see
a test clip on `?playback&cutscene=1` and think it's broken). When testing via automation, use throwaway ids
and clean up afterward; restore `replay:last`. Cross-ref §59 (transform-replay backdrop this supersedes for
foreground), §58 (`?bench` seeded-replay foundation reused), §30 (simplest-thing-that-works).

## 63. Intro cutscene is gated by server progress alone (no client `introSeen`), so `reset-progress` replays it

The intro's one-time-ness comes from **`current_progress`**: the server serves the `introTrace`-carrying
`level-1` descriptor only while `current_progress === 1`, and `finishIntro` → `unlockNextLevel` advances
1→2 (thereafter the served level has no `introTrace`). So the bootstrap gate is now a pure
`shouldPlayIntro(location.search, CATALOG.level.introTrace)` — "the served level carries `introTrace`" +
the existing headless check — and nothing else. We **dropped the redundant client
`localStorage['introSeen']` guard**: it persisted across a server-side progress reset and permanently
suppressed the cutscene on that browser, so `reset-progress` dropped the player straight into the playable
Level 0 instead of replaying the intro (the exact bug found in live-test). **Trade-off accepted:** if
`finishIntro`'s server advance fails (e.g. a network error) progress stays 1, so a reload replays the
cutscene — acceptable, because the replay is READ-ONLY (`G.replayMode`) and skippable and correctly
reflects "you have not actually advanced." Single source of truth, simpler (§30). Cross-ref §61 (the
`current_progress` +1 intro model) and §62 (the input-replay the cutscene rides on).

## 64. Language switching is surfaced only on the welcome screen, the Settings modal, and the intro cutscene — one re-localize entry point drives all toggle hosts via a small registry

**Problem.** A player whose browser defaulted to Russian (common on itch.io) could only change language via
the EN/RU toggle on the **welcome screen** — which a brand-new player never sees (the intro drops them straight
into the Level-0 cutscene) and returning players skip (they land on the Main Window / a live fight). They were
stuck in the wrong language with no escape.

**Decision.** Surface the same EN/RU toggle in two more places — the **Settings modal** (`#settings-lang`, the
single post-intro path, reachable anywhere incl. mid-fight since the gear pauses) and the **intro cutscene**
(`#cutscene-lang`, a persistent top-left toggle beside Skip) — and **not** as a persistent in-combat HUD control
or on the Main Window / hangar / shop (Settings is the one place, keeping the chrome uncluttered; §30). No new
i18n framework: this is pure wiring of the existing mechanism (§10) into two more hosts.

**How.** A **single re-localize entry point** — `applyTranslations()`, called by both bootstrap's initial load
and `setLanguage()` — re-renders **every** mounted toggle host from a module-scoped `langHosts` registry (via the
pure `langButtons(current)` helper + `mountLangSwitch()`). Putting the host rebuild in `applyTranslations()` (not
only in `setLanguage`) is load-bearing: bootstrap resolves + loads the real language and then calls
`applyTranslations()` **without** ever calling `setLanguage`, so a non-`en` initial load (the RU-on-itch target
user) highlights the right button on **first paint** instead of staying stuck on EN. To avoid an import cycle
(`welcome.js` already imports from `settings.js`/`credits.js`), the static `#settings-lang` host is mounted from
the i18n-glue module (`welcome.js`) rather than importing `setLanguage` into `settings.js`; the dynamic cutscene
host is mounted from `main.js` (which already imports from `welcome.js`).

**Cutscene safety.** `cutOverlayEl` has a whole-overlay click→advance listener, so the cutscene toggle host is a
separate `<body>` sibling (its clicks don't bubble through the overlay) **and** each button `stopPropagation`s
(belt-and-suspenders) — tapping it re-localizes the visible card in place without advancing/skipping. Its
lifecycle is tied to the cutscene overlay (built in `buildCutsceneOverlay()`, removed in `cutsceneEnd()`), so it
can't leak into the playable-Level-0 fallback (which never builds the overlay) nor live Level 1. Cross-ref §10
(single i18n path), §30 (no gold-plating), §63 (the intro cutscene it rides on).
