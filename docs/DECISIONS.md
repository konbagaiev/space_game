# Space combat — decisions and notes

The prototype: a single `index.html` file, Three.js from a CDN (via importmap). Opens with a
double click in the browser, nothing to install.

## 1. Engine: Three.js (not Godot/Unity)

**Why:** for "a few 3D ships fighting on a plane" we need the fastest possible start.
Three.js = one HTML file, no installation, instant result, easy to share.
Unity is heavy (Hub, license, C#), Godot needs an editor and installation.

**When to reconsider Godot:** when we get to physics (real collisions),
a visual level editor, or multiplayer — that's where an engine truly pays off.
For now Three.js isn't holding us back.

## 2. Ship controls and physics (inertia)

An "Asteroids-like" model:
- `W/S` (or `↑/↓`) — thrust forward/backward along the nose.
- `A/D` (or `←/→`) — turn only the nose, without touching the movement vector.
- `Space` — fire.

Specifics:
- **Pure inertia:** no friction, no speed limit while thrusting — we fly along the accumulated
  vector, wherever the nose is pointing (you can drift sideways and shoot forward).
- **Passive braking:** if NOT a SINGLE control button is pressed — velocity smoothly
  decays (`IDLE_DRAG`). Hold a turn to aim and the inertia is preserved.
- **Arena boundaries:** at the wall the velocity along the axis is zeroed (no bounce). Arena ±240.

Knobs: `ACCEL` (acceleration), `TURN` (turning), `IDLE_DRAG` (braking), `ARENA` (size).

## 3. Camera

- Nearly vertical (top-down view), **fixed angle**, does NOT rotate with the ship's turn.
- **Rigidly attached to the player** (`CAM_OFFSET`), without smoothing/lag — otherwise switching
  direction caused "jitter" and a slight "floating".

---

## 4. Background: three layers by depth

1. **Stars** — a distant static backdrop, glued to the camera (no parallax). Varying
   brightness (a power-law distribution: many dim ones, rare bright ones).
2. **Asteroids** — a small layer BEHIND the combat plane, in world coordinates (NOT attached
   to the camera). When flying they rush past → giving a sense of speed. A single `InstancedMesh`
   (1 draw call). Knobs: `ROCK_COUNT`, size, `ROCK_SPREAD`.
3. **Planet + 2 moons** — light parallax (`PARALLAX`), so depth is felt.
   The moons orbit the planet (`updateMoons`), they don't rotate themselves → terminators stay consistent.

---

## 5. Lighting — TWO independent lights via two render passes (important!)

**The task:** light the combat with one light, the planet/moons with another (with a real day/night).

**What did NOT work (dead ends):**
- **Light layers (`layers`)** — didn't give a clean separation. At the very least `AmbientLight`
  is global and ignores layers → it flooded the planet flatly, killing the terminator.
- **Baking day/night into vertex colors** (`MeshBasic`) — it worked, but the planet came out
  flat/unrealistic (no volume and no soft terminator from real light).

**What worked (the current solution):** two render passes, each with its own scene and its own light.
- `scene` (combat: ships, rocks, bullets, explosions) — its own light: `AmbientLight` + `sun`.
- `skyScene` (planet, moons, stars) — its own light: a weak ambient (the night side) +
  a side `skySun` (gives a real terminator).
- The loop: `renderer.autoClear=false`; `clear()` → `render(skyScene)` → `clearDepth()` →
  `render(scene)`. The space background is drawn by `skyScene.background`, with `scene.background = null`.

Knobs: planet day — the intensity of `skySun` and its position (= the "sun" direction);
night — the ambient in `skyScene`; combat — the light in `scene` (no need to touch it, it's "correct").

**Stars vs transparency:** the stars are made NON-transparent (`transparent:false`) + `depthWrite:false`
+ `renderOrder:-1`. Otherwise (as transparent) they were drawn AFTER the planet and crept onto its disk.

## 6. Combat

- Enemies: **2 hits** (hp 2, shot damage 1). 4 enemies, spawning in a ring around the player.
- Enemy AI: turn toward the player → keep your distance (~14–22) → shoot once aimed.
- A **micro-explosion** at the hit point: a short (`EXPLOSION_LIFE ≈ 0.16s`) fiery flash
  (an additive sphere, quickly expanding and fading).

### Engine trail (exhaust)

The `trail` system (analogous to explosions): when thrusting forward (`W`/`↑`), glowing additive
particles fly out of the nozzle, fading and shrinking over `TRAIL_LIFE` (~0.55s).

The particle physics matters: **the starting velocity = the ship's velocity + ejection backward along the nozzle**
(`shipVel + (-fwd) * EXHAUST_SPEED`). So the exhaust depends on the ship's motion (at speed
it flies along with it rather than lagging behind) and on the nozzle direction (`-fwd`); when turning while drifting
the jet goes along the new nose direction.

The exhaust parameters now live in the **engine** (`engine.exhaust`): `speed` (how fast
the particles separate backward), `life` (trail length), `size` (thickness), `spread` (scatter), `color`.
See section 8 about the component-based model.

## 7. How to check the picture (for development)

A regular screen capture is blocked by the system. Instead — a headless render via Playwright:
`/tmp/shoot.mjs` loads `index.html` in headless Chromium and writes a PNG.
⚠️ Caveat: swiftshader in headless sometimes diverges from a real browser in subtle things
(transparency order) — do the final check in a real browser.

## 8. Ship model: data components

**Why:** to move away from a scatter of hardcoded constants toward a structure from which a ship
is assembled — groundwork for upgrades, different ships/enemies, and balance.

Catalogs in `client/index.html`: `ENGINES`, `HULLS`, `WEAPONS`. A ship (player/enemy) references
components (loadout: `hull` / `engine` / `weapon`), and the logic reads stats from there.

- **The engine** includes the **exhaust** (`exhaust`) as its own part — the trail parameters are taken from
  the engine, not from global constants.
- **Projectiles** carry the damage and speed of their weapon — that's why different weapons produce different bullets from
  a single `spawnBullet(from, dir, weapon, fromPlayer)` function.
- Some fields are intentionally **groundwork** and don't affect logic yet: `weight`, `durability`
  (on the engine), `volume`. They're easy to start using (mass → inertia, durability → failures).

The principle: **a new mechanic = first a stat on a component, then reading it in the logic**,
not a new global constant.
